# Sentencing

## General Points

Before sentencing, counsel will:

{{< hint info >}}
1.  Ascertain the range of sentence by looking at the penalty provisions
    in the *Code* or statute;

2.  Decide on a sentence to recommend (kind and quantum of time, money)

3.  Seek to support the recommendation by citing purposes and principles
    in *Code* or statute.

## 1\. Kind and range of sentence

*Code* provisions will indicate whether an offence is strictly summary
or indictable, or hybrid. An offence is hybrid where it allows for
prosecution either "on summary conviction" or "by indictment".

If the offence is hybrid, at the outset, the Crown must elect to proceed
with the prosecution of the offence "summarily" or "by indictment". (It
may change its election in light of a change in circumstances, such as
new evidence indicating more severe injuries.)[^1]

A summary offence in the *Code* is punishable by **up to** 2 years in
jail and **up to** a fine of \$5k or both (s. 787), unless the penalty
provision in the offence states otherwise.[^2]

An indictable offence in the *Code* may have a minimum punishment and
range up to life; but the offence provision will indicate the range.

## 2\. Decide on a sentence to recommend

The kind and quantum of sentence will depend on many factors, including:

> -what kind of sentence is available given the nature of the offence or
> the limits set out in the offence provision;[^3]
>
> -the person's criminal record;
>
> -the circumstances of the offence (including the degree of offender's
> culpability);
>
> -aggravating circumstances, primarily those set out in sections 718.01
> to 718.2(a); and
>
> -mitigating circumstances, including: remorse, steps toward
> rehabilitation (counseling), age (youth or old age), lack of a record,
> strong support in the community (family, friends), dependents,
> employment, low probability of reoffending (in light of psychiatric or
> other evidence).

## 3\. Purposes and principles in support of the recommendation

Counsel will cite purposes and principles set out in a statute to
support or justify their recommended sentence and quantum. Key
provisions in the *Code* include:[^4]

> **Purpose \[of sentencing\]**
>
> **718** The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society
> and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect
> for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society
> by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following
> objectives:
>
> (a) to denounce unlawful conduct and the harm done to victims or to
> the community that is caused by unlawful conduct;
>
> (b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;
>
> (c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;
>
> (d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;
>
> (e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the
> community; and
>
> (f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and
> acknowledgment of the harm done to victims or to the community.
>
> **'Fundamental Principle'**
>
> **718.1** A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the
> offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

> **'Other Sentencing Principles'**
>
> **718.2** A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into
> consideration the following principles:
>
> **(a)** a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any
> relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the
> offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the
> foregoing,
>
> **(i)** evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or
> hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour,
> religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation,
> or gender identity or expression, or on any other similar factor,
>
> **(ii)** evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused
> the offender's intimate partner or a member of the victim or the
> offender's family,
>
> **(ii.1)** evidence that the offender, in committing the offence,
> abused a person under the age of eighteen years,
>
> **(iii)** evidence that the offender, in committing the offence,
> abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim,
>
> **(iii.1)** evidence that the offence had a significant impact on the
> victim, considering their age and other personal circumstances,
> including their health and financial situation,
>
> **(iv)** evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of,
> at the direction of or in association with a criminal organization,
>
> **(v)** evidence that the offence was a terrorism offence, or
>
> **(vi)** evidence that the offence was committed while the offender
> was subject to a conditional sentence order made under section 742.1
> or released on parole, statutory release or unescorted temporary
> absence under the *Corrections and Conditional Release Act*
>
> shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;
>
> **(b)** a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar
> offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;
>
> **(c)** where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence
> should not be unduly long or harsh;
>
> **(d)** an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less
> restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and
>
> **(e)** all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are
> reasonable in the circumstances and consistent with the harm done to
> victims or to the community should be considered for all offenders,
> with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal
> offenders.

[^1]: See, for example, s. 264 of the *Code*.

[^2]: For example, s 320.19(1)(b) imposes a mandatory fine of \$1k for a
    first offence of impaired driving, if the Crown proceeds by
    summarily.

[^3]: For example, a conditional sentence is not available under
    circumstances set out in section 742.1.

[^4]: For the sake of brevity (and for exam purposes), we can omit
    sections 718.01 to 718.04.
