# Summary of Presumptions, Burdens, and Reasonable Doubt

## i\. Presumptions and burdens

Where the Crown proves fact A, a presumption permits the court to
presume fact B. In many cases, fact B is an element of an offence that
is difficult for the Crown to prove but flows logically from proof of
fact A.

Most presumptions are *rebuttable*, some are *irrebuttable.*

Among the class of rebuttable presumptions, we distinguish between
evidentiary legal presumptions.

### Evidentiary presumptions:

Evidentiary presumptions apply in provisions that use the phrase "in the
**absence of evidence to the contrary**" (or something similar).[^1]

They require the accused to adduce (or point to) **some** evidence to
the contrary, but **not to prove anything**.

An evidentiary presumption gives rise to an *evidentiary burden* ('some
evidence').

**Test for meeting an evidentiary burden**

The test for what constitutes **an "air of reality"** or "some evidence," is: "any or some evidence on which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could convict" (*Cinous*, *Fontaine*). Whether this test is met is for the judge to decide, not the jury. (*i.e.*, is there a *possibility* the contrary fact is true? The Crown must prove -- must persuade the trier of fact -- that there is no *reasonable* possibility that it *is* true.)

### Legal presumptions

Legal presumptions apply in provisions that use the phrase “unless he
establishes…” (or something similar).[^2]

If the Crown proves fact A, a legal presumption permits the court to
presume fact B unless the accused **proves** otherwise.

Legal presumptions give rise to a *persuasive burden* on the accused (a
'reverse onus'). In criminal law, where the persuasive burden falls upon
the accused, the standard is proof on a balance of probabilities.

Whenever a provision of law places an accused in a reverse onus (*i.e.*,
imposing a persuasive burden) to prove an **essential element of an
offence**, the provision violates section 11(d) of the *Charter*.
(*Oakes*)

In some cases, the violation might be saved under section 1; in some it
may not.[^3]

## ii\. Presumption of Innocence:

Sources of the presumption of innocence can be found at common law
(*Woolmington*), section 6 of the *Criminal Code*, and section 11(d) of
the *Charter*, which guarantees the right:

> "to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a
> fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal."

The SCC in *Oakes* affirmed that the presumption of innocence in 11(d)
requires the Crown to prove the elements of an offence beyond a
reasonable doubt.

In *Woolmington*, the UK House of Lords held that once the Crown
establishes a *prima facie* case for the elements of an offence, the
burden does not shift to the accused to prove a defence. The burden
remains on the Crown to prove that a defence **does not apply**.

*Woolmington* and *Oakes* note an exception to this rule. An accused
seeking to rely on the defence of mental disorder bears the onus of
proving it (on a balance of probabilities).[^4]

## iii\. The requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt

The SCC in *Lifchus* held that 'reasonable doubt' has a special meaning
in law, which should be explained to juries:

> -it is not based on sympathy or prejudice
>
> -it is logically connected to the evidence or absence of it
>
> -it is based upon reason and common sense
>
> -it is not proof to an absolute certainty; it is not proof beyond
> any doubt, nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt
>
> -it is not met where accused is "probably guilty"

In *Starr*, the SCC held that the reasonable doubt standard is "much
closer to absolute certainty than to proof on a balance of
probabilities".

[^1]: See *Code* section 348(2) for an example.

[^2]: See *Code* section 320.35 for an example.

[^3]: For example, the one in *Chaulk* is saved (mental disorder); the
    one in *Oakes* is not (intention for trafficking).

[^4]: The burden also shifts to the accused where they seek to rely on
    other defences premised on a lack of voluntariness: extreme
    intoxication and automatism. Once again, these violate 11(d) but are
    saved under 1.
