# Confessions Summary

## Preliminary Considerations:

Was the accused's statement a confession or '*res gestae*'?

*Res gestae* statements are those made spontaneously, during or soon
after an offence takes place.

At common law, they are admissible and an exception to the voluntariness
rule.

Where police obtain a statement from the accused that is not *res
gestae*, the accused may challenge its admissibility on the basis that
it was obtained **contrary** to
{{< hint info >}}
\(a\) the common law Confessions Rule,

\(b\) the *Charter*: s. 7 (silence), 10(a/b), 11(c)(compulsion), 13
(incrimination); or

\(c\) if the accused were aged 12 to 17, section 146 of the *Youth
Criminal Justice Act*.

## 1. The Common Law Confessions Rule:

At common law, a confession or statement made to a person in authority
is inadmissible unless the Crown can prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that it was made voluntarily. (*Boudreau*)

*R v Oickle* (SCC 2000) is now the leading authority on voluntariness of
confessions, consolidating earlier law into a two-stage test.[^1] The
court should ask:

{{< hint info >}}
i.  Where a statement was obtained involving the use of police
    trickery--**regardless** of whether the statement was made to a
    Person in Authority (PIA)--would the police conduct "shock the
    community"? If yes, the statement is involuntary; **if not**:

ii. Apply a "general voluntariness analysis," asking whether the Crown
    has proved, BARD, that a statement made **to a PIA** was
    voluntary, in the sense that:

a.  the accused's will was not overborne by one or more **strong** inducements, or a **significant** degree of oppression (or a
combination thereof), **and**

b.  the accused did not lack an operating mind.
{{< /hint >}}

-the emphasis at the first stage of the test (community shock) is less
on voluntariness than on maintaining the integrity of the criminal
justice system. Trickery can raise a doubt about voluntariness, but it
may not and can still "shock the community," resulting in the exclusion
of the confession. (*Oickle*)

-at the second stage of the test, the court should consider all of the
factors together to assess whether the statement was made voluntarily
beyond a reasonable doubt. (*Oickle*)

-one or more **strong** threats or inducements alone or in combination
with other factors could raise a reasonable doubt about voluntariness.
(*Oickle*)

-in assessing whether the 'operating mind' test (defined below) has been
met, the court should consider all the circumstances, including
oppression, inducements, and trickery. (*Oickle*)

-a failure for the Crown at either stage of the test results in the
exclusion of evidence (*i.e.*, no 24(2)).

-a threat or inducement need not be overt; the question of whether an
inducement has been made turns on whether there has been a *quid pro
quo*. (*Oickle*)

-by virtue of requiring a strong inducement or a significant degree of
oppression, the CL rule permits **some** degree of trickery, oppression
and/or inducements (*i.e*., up to the point at which a reasonable doubt
about voluntariness is raised). (*Oickle*)

-**oppressive circumstances include**: being deprived of food, water,
sleep; being denied access to counsel; being presented with fabricated
evidence; or being questioned aggressively at length. (*Oickle*)

-the **standard for "operating mind"** is low: the accused must have
"known what she is saying and that it may be used by the police to her
detriment." (*Oickle*, *Whittle*)

-to be clear: under the 'general voluntariness analysis' in *Oickle*, to
find a statement involuntary, the trier of fact need not conclude that
the accused's will *was* overborne (by one or more strong inducements,
etc...), but only that there was a *reasonable possibility* that it was.

"[A] trial judgeâ€™s application of the voluntariness framework is a question of fact or of mixed fact and law attracting appellate deference" (*Beaver*, *Tessier*, *Oickle*)

### Absence of a police caution

Where police obtain a statement from a suspect who is not detained and has not been cautioned, the absence of a caution is *prima facie* evidence of "an unfair denial of choice" but is not determinative of voluntariness on its own. The Crown must show that "the absence of a caution did not undermine the suspect's free choice to speak to police". Whether a statement was given voluntarily (beyond a reasonable doubt) depends on the totality of the circumstances. (*Tessier*)

### Who is a 'person in authority'?

In *Grandinetti*, the SCC held: "The operative question is whether the
accused, based on his or her \[reasonable\] perception of the
recipient's ability to influence the prosecution, believed either that
refusing to make a statement to the person would result in prejudice, or
that making one would result in favourable treatment".

A PIA is someone "formally engaged in the arrest, detention, examination
or prosecution of the accused" and would include police officers and
prison officials or guards. (*Hodgson*)

A PIA may also include "persons whom the accused reasonably believes are
acting on behalf of the state and could therefore influence or control
the proceedings against him or her." (*Hodgson*)

Whether someone is a PIA is assessed both subjectively and objectively:
what did the accused believe or perceive, and was that belief or
perception reasonable? (*Rothman, Grandinetti*)

Undercover officers are generally not PIA's. (*Rothman*, *Grandinetti*)

## 2. The Right to Counsel under Section 10(b) of the *Charter*:

{{< hint info >}}
Section 10(b) of the Charter states that "[e]veryone has the right on
arrest or detention [...] to retain and instruct counsel without delay
and to informed of that right".
{{< /hint >}}

The purpose of this right is to provide a person the information
necessary to make an informed choice as to whether to speak to or
cooperate with authorities. The *interests* it is meant to protect are
dignity and personal autonomy. (*Clarkson, Brydges*, and *Sinclair*)

Where a person may have been subject to a form of non-legal
psychological compulsion amounting to detention, the court would apply
the test for detention in *Grant.* (Put another way: to decide whether a
person was detained when they gave a statement that should have been
preceded by 10(a) and (b), a court would apply the test in *Grant,*
which defines detention for *both* sections 9 and 10.)

### Information and implementation components

To validly discharge their duty under section 10(b), police, on arrest
or detention, have a duty to fulfill an information and implementation
component, with each comprising a set of subsidiary duties:[^2]

{{< hint info >}}
1.  To fulfill the **information** component, police must:

  a.  advise the person that they have a right to "retain and instruct" (consult) counsel without delay;

  b.  advise of the availability of legal aid or free duty counsel and provide numbers; (*Brydges*, *Bartle*, *Prosper*)

[then, if the person expresses a will to exercise the right---or does
not explicitly or impliedly **waive** the right (and the waiver is
valid, see below), police must aid in implementing 10(b)\]

2.  To fulfill the **implementation** component, police must:

a.  provide a suspect with **a reasonable opportunity to speak** to either counsel of choice or duty counsel, **in private** (this includes providing them with access to a phone in a private space);

b.  do so **without delay** (unless there are urgent circumstances);

**and**

c.  **hold off on questioning** or **eliciting evidence** until the suspect has had a reasonable opportunity to speak to a lawyer.
(*Manninen*, *Brydges*, *Prosper*; *Smith*, *Ross*)
{{< /hint >}}

*Delay, Search, and Questioning*

Police are not obligated to suspend the search incident to arrest until
the detainee has the opportunity to retain counsel. (*Debot*)

The burden is on the Crown to show that a delay in implementing 10(b)
was reasonable in the circumstances. (*Taylor*)

The state has no obligation under 10(b) to make duty counsel available
after business hours, but where an accused expresses a desire to
exercise 10(b) and duty counsel is not available (and no other counsel
is made available to them), police must hold off on questioning or
eliciting evidence from the person until they have had a reasonable
opportunity to consult counsel. (*Prosper*)

*Waiver*

A valid waiver of 10(b) is one that is (a) "clear and unequivocal" and
(b) made when the person is "fully aware of the consequences of waiving
the right." (*Clarkson*; *Brydges*)

A person may impliedly waive 10(b), but the waiver must be clear and
unequivocal, and it must be informed---*i.e.*, the person must be clear
about the availability of free duty counsel, and the waiver may not be
premised on a misapprehension that a desire to exercise 10(b) is itself
incriminating. (*Brydges*)

The waiver of 10(b) by an *extremely* drunk suspect may be challenged as
equivocal; he or she must be given time to sober up and warned about
10(b) again. While waiting, police must abstain from questioning.
(*Clarkson*)

*Obligation on detainee to be diligent*

An accused must be "reasonably diligent" in their exercise of
10(b) or it lapses. An accused cannot use the opportunity to contact
counsel to stall. If they cannot reach counsel of choice after
reasonable efforts are made over a reasonable period of time, they must
settle with duty counsel (if available). (*Smith*, *Ross*)

*Prosper warning*

Where a person expresses a desire to exercise 10(b) and is diligent in
the exercise of the right but cannot reach counsel (of choice or duty
counsel), a waiver of 10(b) at that time will not be valid unless police
provide a '***Prosper* warning**':

> Police in this case must, once again, advise the detainee of "her
> right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and of the
> obligation on the part of the police during this time not to take any
> statements or require the detainee to participate in any potentially
> incriminating process until she has had that reasonable opportunity."
> (*Prosper*)

*Obligation to confirm adequacy*

Where an accused person's consultation with counsel is brief, or
otherwise raises concerns, the accused has the onus of promptly and/or
diligently raising this with police. Police do not have a duty to
inquire into the adequacy of advice provided to an accused. (*Willier*)

*Limited right to re-consult*

A person does not have a right to consult counsel again **unless** there
is a material change in circumstances (*e.g.,* a change in investigative
procedure or jeopardy), or unless there is reason to believe the first
opportunity to consult was inadequate. (*Sinclair*)

If the reason for the arrest or detention itself changes, a person must
also be given their 10(a) and (b) warnings again. (*Borden; Sinclair*)

*No right to counsel present*

Suspects do not have a right under 10(b) of the *Charter* to have
counsel present throughout an in-custody police interrogation.[^3]
(*Sinclair*)

## 3. The Right to Silence under the *Charter*:

{{< hint info >}}
Section 7 of the *Charter* states:

> "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person
> and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the
> principles of fundamental justice."
{{< /hint >}}

The SCC in *Hebert* held that section 7 protects the right to silence by
virtue of the Court's recognition in that case that it is a 'principle
of fundamental justice' that a person will not be deprived of their
liberty in violation of the right to silence.

The purpose of the right is to protect a person's ability to make a free
choice about to whether to speak to or cooperate with authorities. The
right protects an interest in dignity and autonomy. (*Hebert*)

(Note that an accused also has a right to silence at common law, pre-dating the *Charter*. The Supreme Court in *Turcotte* [2005] held that the common law right to silence applies any time a suspect or accused interacts with a person in authority, whether detained or not. In that case it served to preclude an inference of guilt from the accused's refusal to answer questions by police.)

### Test for breach of right to silence

In *Hebert*, the Court held that the right to silence under section 7 applies only to a person detained or in custody and is breached where an accused can establish, on a balance of probabilities, that police obtained a statement when:

{{< hint info >}}
i\. he or she lacked an operating mind [see test from *Whittle* noted above]; or

ii\. police conduct "effectively and unfairly deprived" him or her
from exercising a free choice to speak to authorities. (Most commonly:
through persistent, aggressive questioning or the use of UC officer in
detention who actively elicits information.)
{{< /hint >}}

Where an accused has consulted counsel and expresses the will to remain
silent, police may still question him or her. (*Hebert*, *Singh*)

*When do 7 and 10(b) apply?*

Generally speaking, police violate s. 10(b) where they *fail* to do something (which would help the detainee make an informed choice about whether to provide a statement); by contrast, police violate the right to silence in s. 7 where they *do* something (*i.e.*, elicit evidence in a way that vitiates a person's choice).

### Continuous questioning

The fact that police continue to question a suspect despite **repeated**
assertions of the will to remain silent does not -- in itself -- violate the right to silence under s. 7. (*Singh*)

However, at some point, continuous questioning in the face of an express will to remain silent, alone or combined with other circumstances, *may* amount to proof on a balance of probabilities that the right to silence has been violated by virtue of the police having vitiated the suspect's exercise of free choice about whether to speak.

Note that if an accused were unsuccessful in establishing that being continuously questioned violated their right to silence, they might try to establish that the questioning raises a reasonable doubt about whether the statement was made voluntarily (under the common law confessions rule). They might also try to establish that the questioning raises a reasonable doubt about the veracity of the statement they gave. (*Singh*)

### Statements obtained by undercover officer

Where an accused exercises the right to counsel, expresses the desire to
remain silent, and is held in police custody, police may seek to obtain
evidence through the use of an undercover officer or informant acting at
the direction of the police. In this case, the UC or informant must not
*actively elicit* evidence through questioning. Active eliciting
violates the right to silence under s. 7. (*Hebert*, *Liew*)

An undercover agent or informer "elicits" information where he or she
*directs* the conversation to a material issue, rather than allowing the
conversation to unfold naturally. (*Broyles*)

## 4. Mr Big scenarios

A special test applies to the admissibility of statements obtained by undercover
  officers in a 'Mr Big' scenario (*i.e.*, statements made out of custody).

  The Supreme Court in *Hart* held these to be presumptively inadmissible unless the Crown establishes on a balance of probabilities that the probative value of the confession outweighs its prejudicial effect and that the statement was not the product of an abuse of process. Determining probative value involves an assessment of indicia of reliability. A statement obtained involuntarily is one possible form of an abuse of process.


[^1]: In the case of a confession given in a "Mr. Big" scenario, the
    relevant test for admissibility is set out in *R v Hart* (SCC 2014).

[^2]: There are some contexts in which a person may be detained but is
    not entitled to be informed of, or to exercise, 10(b) rights
    immediately: *e.g.*, when asked to provide a breath sample at
    *roadside* in an impaired driving investigation (*Thomsen*, SCC
    1988); when police detain and question drivers for general vehicle
    offence investigations under the *Motor Vehicle Act*; or when people
    are questioned briefly upon entering Canada in 'primary inspection'
    (*Simmons*, SCC 1988).

[^3]: Under section 146 of the *Youth Criminal Justice Act*, "young
    persons" under the act have a right to have counsel present when
    providing a statement.
