Arrest and Detention",section:"Procedural Topics",content:"Arrest and Detention Summary #  General points: #  Section 9 of the Charter guarantees everyone a right \u0026ldquo;not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.\u0026rdquo;\nA detention will be arbitrary under s. 9 if it is not authorized by law, the law under which it is authorized is itself arbitrary, or the detention is not carried out in a reasonable manner (Le).\nPolice may question, but if not detained or under arrest, a person may refuse to cooperate (including ID, unless there is a legal requirement to provide this). (Grant, Le)\nPolice have the power to carry out an \u0026lsquo;investigative detention\u0026rsquo; where they have a reasonable suspicion implicating the person in an offence being investigated and where it is reasonably necessary on an objective view of the totality of the circumstances (Mann). An investigative detention triggers 10(a) and (b) of the Charter [more detail below].\nPolice also have the power to carry out a limited frisk search incident to investigative detention where they have a reasonable suspicion that safety is at risk.\nPolice may arrest on grounds set out in section 495(1) and in certain other situations (under statute and common law: e.g., breach of the peace under s. 31 of the Code and at CL: Hayes v Thompson).\nPolice may carry out a limited search incident to arrest without requiring further grounds. A strip search upon arrest requires additional grounds, and a strip search at the scene of arrest requires grounds in addition to those [more detail below].\nArrest powers under the Criminal Code: #  Pursuant to section 495(1) of the Criminal Code, a PO may arrest a person where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that an individual is subject to an arrest warrant, or has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence [which includes a hybrid offence], or if she finds a person committing any offence.1\nMeaning of reasonable grounds\nThe Supreme Court in Storrey held that a valid arrest under s. 495(1)(a) requires that the officer to hold the \u0026lsquo;reasonable belief\u0026rsquo; subjectively and that the belief be objectively reasonable, which is to say \u0026ldquo;a reasonable person, standing in the shoes of the police officer, would have believed that reasonable and probable grounds existed\u0026rdquo;. (On what constitutes \u0026lsquo;reasonable grounds\u0026rsquo;, see \u0026lsquo;A note on standards\u0026rsquo; below.)\nArrest powers of citizens and property owners\nPersons other than peace officers may arrest without a warrant anyone they find committing an indictable office, or anyone they have reasonable grounds to believe has committed a \u0026lsquo;criminal offence\u0026rsquo; (summary or indictable) and is being freshly pursued by someone with lawful authority to arrest: s. 494. By contrast (to other civilians), property owners may arrest a person they find committing a \u0026lsquo;criminal offence\u0026rsquo; (see s. 494(2) for further qualifications).\nOther Code powers\nThe Code contains a host of other arrest powers relied upon less often than those in 495(1), including the power in s 495.1 to carry out an arrest without warrant on reasonable grounds to believe an accused has breached (or will) terms of a summons, appearance notice, undertaking or release order; and powers to arrest for \u0026lsquo;breach of the peace\u0026rsquo; (ss 30 and 31).\nBreach of the peace involves actions that cause or are likely to cause harm to persons or property. The Code authorizes detention or arrest for this, but does not make it an offence. Civilians may detain for breaches of peace they witness (s. 30); police for this but also at common law for those immediately imminent (s. 31 and Thompson v Hayes, BCCA 1985; Brown v Durham, OCA 1998).\nA PO or civilian may use as much force as is reasonably necessary to effect a lawful arrest, s 25(1).\nGeneral principle supporting release\nSection 493.1 compels police officers and judges to \u0026ldquo;give primary consideration to the release of the accused at the earliest reasonable opportunity and on the least onerous conditions that are appropriate in the circumstances\u0026rdquo;. They must also \u0026ldquo;give particular attention to the circumstances of (a) aboriginal accused; and (b) accusted who belong to a vulnerable population that is overrepresented in the criminal justice system and that is disadvantaged in obtaining release under this Part\u0026rdquo; (493.2).\nPublic interest grounds\nFor a range of offences set out in section 495(2) [summary, hybrid, and indictable offences under s. 553], police must release a person immediately after \u0026ldquo;arrest\u0026rdquo; (or in lieu of carrying out a full arrest) unless detaining them further is necessary for any of the \u0026ldquo;public interest\u0026rdquo; reasons set out in s. 495(2) (ID, evidence, avoiding continuation/repetition of offence, or to ensure court attendance).\nWarrantless entry to effect arrest\nUnder section 529.3(1) of the Criminal Code, police may enter a dwelling house without a warrant in order to carry out an arrest where they have reasonable grounds to believe the person is present and the conditions are present to obtain a warrant under 529.1 (RPG) but due to exigent circumstances this is not practicable. For the purposes of this section, exigent circs are defined 529.3(2) to require (a) reasonable grounds to suspect that it is necessary to prevent imminent danger of bodily harm or death, or (b) reasonable grounds to believe that entry is necessary to prevent against the imminent loss or destruction of evidence of an indictable offence.\nAncillary Powers (Common Law): #  1. Search Incident to Arrest #  Police are authorized at common law to conduct a search incident to arrest where:\n the arrest is lawful; the search is truly incidental to the arrest (i.e., conducted for a valid law enforcement purpose related to the reason for the arrest); and the search is conducted reasonably.  (Fearon)\n No additional grounds\nAt common law, when police carry out a lawful arrest, they also have authority to carry out a limited search incident to arrest without needing separate and additional grounds.\nScope of SITA\nSITA may entail a brief pat down of clothing (but not the removal of clothing) and the search of pockets, bags, and \u0026ldquo;immediate surroundings\u0026rdquo; (Cloutier). The latter can include the inside of a car in which (or close to which) a person is arrested (Caslake).\nValid criminal justice objective\nThe Court in Cloutier and Caslake held that a search incident to arrest must be carried out for a \u0026ldquo;valid objective in pursuit of the ends of criminal justice\u0026rdquo;, such as:\n the discovery of an object that may be a threat to the safety of the police, the accused or the public, or that may facilitate escape; the discovery evidence against the accused; the preservation of evidence from destruction.   A search incident to arrest may not be conducted to intimidate or be carried out in an abusive manner. (Cloutier)\nTime and distance\nSearch of things seized upon arrest may also be carried out later in time, or at a distance from the place of the arrest, if the search is carried out for a valid criminal justice purpose connected to the offence for which the person was arrested and there is a reasonable explanation for the delay. (Caslake)\nTruly incidental\nWhere there is an issue as to whether a search was truly incidental to arrest (whether it was conducted for a criminal justice objective connected to the offence for which the person was arrested), the court will apply a twofold test:\n(a) did the officer subjectively conduct the search for a an objective connected to the reason for the arrest; and\n(b) was this objectively reasonable in the circumstances? (Caslake)\n  For example, in Caslake, the car was searched not to advance a legitimate criminal justice objective, but merely as part of a police policy to ensure the safekeeping of goods seized. The officer thus lacked a subjective intent tied to the reason for the arrest. But if he did act with this intention, it would have been objectively reasonable, given the clear connection between the reason for the arrest (PPT) and the possibility that drugs might be found in the car. Conversely, if a person were arrested for shoplifting cigarettes and the officer decided to conduct a search of the person\u0026rsquo;s bag because the officer subjectively believed it might contain drugs (acting on the notion that \u0026ldquo;the person looked to me like a drug dealer\u0026rdquo;), the officer\u0026rsquo;s purpose for the search would not be objectively reasonable since it would not advance a criminal justice objective connected to the reason for the arrest.\n (Note that in practical terms, this two-part test is relevant only where an accused raises an issue with whether a search was truly incidental to an arrest \u0026ndash; and thus it does not arise in every case involving a search incident to arrest.)\n\u0026ndash; Search of phone or electronic device on arrest #  In Fearon, the Supreme Court held that police may search a cell-phone or electronic device incident to arrest on four conditions:\ni. the arrest is lawful;\nii. the search is \u0026lsquo;truly incidental to the arrest\u0026rsquo;, meaning that it is carried out promptly and in order to advance one or more of the following law enforcement purposes: to protect the police, the accused, or the public; to preserve evidence; or to discover evidence\u0026mdash;but a cellphone search on arrest for this third purpose is only justified \u0026ldquo;if the investigation will be stymied or significantly hampered absent the ability to promptly conduct the search\u0026rdquo; [para 80];\niii. the nature and extent of the search is tailored to the law enforcement purpose at issue (which in practice will generally mean \u0026ldquo;recently sent or drafted emails, texts, photos and the call log\u0026rdquo; but may reasonably include more, depending on the circumstances; and\niv. the police take detailed notes of what they examined on the device and how.\n Police may conduct a search incident to arrest before the detainee has a chance to speak to a lawyer. (Debot)\n\u0026ndash; Strip search incident to arrest: #  Police are authorized to carry out a strip search following an arrest only where they have (in addition to the grounds for the arrest itself) \u0026ldquo;reasonable and probable grounds to believe it is necessary to carry out a strip search in the circumstances of the arrest\u0026rdquo; for (a) safety or (b) to prevent evidence from being destroyed. (Golden)\nA reasonable strip search is one conducted at the police station in accordance with the guidelines set out in R v Golden, unless there are exigent circumstances.\nPolice may carry out a strip search in public or at the scene of the arrest only where they can establish that, in addition to having grounds for arrest and grounds for a strip search (described above), they have further reasonable grounds to believe that exigent circumstances make it necessary to carry out the search at that time and place for safety or to prevent the loss of evidence. (Golden)\n2. Investigative Detention: #  At common law, police have a power to detain a person briefly for investigative purposes. A detention triggers a person\u0026rsquo;s Charter rights under sections 9 and 10(a) and (b). (Mann, Grant)\nPolice may carry out an \u0026lsquo;investigative detention\u0026rsquo; when they have (a) a reasonable suspicion that the individual is implicated in the offence being investigated and (b) where the detention is reasonably necessary on an objective view of the totality of the circumstances. Factors to consider here include \u0026ldquo;the extent to which the interference with individual liberty is necessary to perform the officer\u0026rsquo;s duty [to investigate crime], the liberty interfered with, and the nature and extent of the interference.\u0026rdquo; (Mann)\nThere must be a clear nexus, based in evidence, tying the particular person detained to the offence being investigated (\u0026ldquo;individualized suspicion\u0026rdquo;). Courts will assess whether an officer had a \u0026lsquo;reasonable\u0026rsquo; suspicion by considering the reasonable person in the officer\u0026rsquo;s position. (Mann)\nAn investigative detention triggers both 10(a) and 10(b). Police must inform the detainee, without delay, of the reason for the detention and their right to retain counsel. But police may briefly delay discharging their duties under 10(b) to carry out a safety search. (Grant, Suberu)\nInvestigative detention is distinct from what the Supreme Court has called \u0026ldquo;preliminary investigative questioning.\u0026rdquo; A person here is not detained and police are not obliged to advise them that they do not have to answer questions. (Suberu)\n\u0026ndash; Blockades #  The Court in Clayton held that police may set up a blockade and detain for investigative purposes persons if (a) doing so still involves individualized suspicion (or a nexus tying detainees to the offence being investigated) and (b) where it is reasonably necessary to do so based on the totality of the circumstances, including:\ni. the nature of the situation (including the seriousness of the offence);\nii. the information known to the police about the crime and/or the suspects; and\niii. whether the stop/detention (i.e. geographic and temporal scope) is reasonably tailored to the offence, and in balancing the risk to the public versus the liberty of citizens, the stop is no more intrusive than is \u0026ldquo;reasonably necessary.\u0026rdquo; (Clayton)\n An investigative detention should be brief, but may be as broad (in time or space) as is \u0026ldquo;reasonably necessary in the totality of the circumstances,\u0026rdquo; so long as its purpose is restricted to investigating the involvement in crime of particular suspects. (Clayton)\n\u0026ndash; Test for whether and when a \u0026lsquo;detention\u0026rsquo; has occurred: #  In Grant, the Supreme Court set out a test for deciding whether a \u0026ldquo;detention\u0026rdquo; for the purpose of sections 9 and 10 has occurred. A person is \u0026ldquo;detained\u0026rdquo; where there is significant:\na. physical restraint, or\nb. psychological compulsion.\n-psychological compulsion is established where there is:\n i. legal compulsion: where an officer makes a demand to comply pursuant to statute: eg, a roadside breath demand; or\nii. non-legal compulsion, which arises in circumstances where \u0026ldquo;police conduct would cause a reasonable person conclude that he or she was not free to go and had to comply with the police direction or demand.\u0026rdquo; [The test is purely objective.]\n The Court in Grant held that whether the reasonable person subject to non-legal compulsion would conclude they were detained depends on the following criteria considered in their totality:\ni. circumstances giving rise to the encounter as reasonably perceived by the individual [were they subject to general inquiries or singled out?];\nii. nature of the police conduct [language, duration, place, physical contact, presence of others, etc.];\niii. particular characteristics/circumstances of the individual [age, physical stature, sophistication, being a member of a racial minority].\n The Supreme Court in Le held that under the 3rd part of this test, the reasonable person in the position of a racialized person is presumed to be aware of the \u0026ldquo;broader historical and social context of race relations between the police and various racial groups and individuals in society.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the broader \u0026lsquo;racialized context\u0026rsquo; of a police encounter with a visible minority, it is irrelevant whether the police involved engaged in racial profiling when assessing whether the reasonable person would have experienced significant compulsion.\nIn a given set of circumstances, a racialized accused might be more likely than a white person to infer that they have no choice but to comply with a police direction or demand \u0026ndash; and this inference may be reasonable in the circumstances, based on the weight of recent social science evidence.\nThe detention analysis in Grant and Le is principally objective in nature. (Evidence of what the police or the accused personally perceived is important, but not determinative of whether the factors pointing to psychological detention were, in their totality, significant.)\n3. Search incident to Investigative Detention: #  At common law, police have a power to search incident to investigative detention, but it does not arise automatically upon a lawful investigative detention. Police must have separate or additional reasonable grounds to suspect that \u0026ldquo;officer safety, or the safety of others, is at risk.\u0026rdquo; (Mann)\nThis must be based on more than a mere hunch or a \u0026lsquo;personal intuition\u0026rsquo; about safety (i.e., police must be able to point to evidence supporting their belief as reasonable). (Mann)\nThe scope of the search may extend no further than what is necessary to address concerns about safety. (Grant)\nA note on standards: #  The common law makes the following distinctions on standards in criminal law:\n  \u0026lsquo;suspicion\u0026rsquo; would be something merely possible, even if its probability is low;\n  a \u0026lsquo;reasonable suspicion\u0026rsquo; would be a reasonable possibility, or something not quite probable but more than hypothetical (SCC: Kang-Brown, Chehil);\n  \u0026lsquo;reasonable grounds to believe\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;reasonable belief\u0026rsquo; have been held by the SCC in Debot and Baron to be synonymous with \u0026lsquo;reasonable and probable grounds,\u0026rsquo; and each is a way of saying there is a reasonable probability of something2; and\n  \u0026lsquo;balance of probability\u0026rsquo; means greater likelihood or \u0026lsquo;more likely than not\u0026rsquo;.\n    Section 34(1)(a) of the Interpretation Act defines an \u0026lsquo;indictable offence\u0026rsquo; to include hybrid offences; see also R v Dudley, SCC 2009, applying this provision to the meaning of \u0026lsquo;indictable offence\u0026rsquo; in the Criminal Code. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Some authorities have suggested the SCC decisions in Debot, Baron, and Storrey support the proposition that \u0026lsquo;reasonable and probable grounds\u0026rsquo; means balance of probabilities or \u0026lsquo;more likely than not\u0026rsquo;. This is a plausible reading, but these cases have not explicitly endorsed this equation. The Court has held that RPG = reasonable probability, which means \u0026lsquo;likely\u0026rsquo; rather than \u0026lsquo;possible\u0026rsquo;, and that RPG is \u0026lsquo;less than a prima facie case for conviction.\u0026rsquo; The precise level of certainty for RPG remains unclear. For an example of a recent court decision outlining the state of this uncertainty, see paras 145-157 in Can v Calgary (Police Service), 2014 ABCA 322. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "}),a.add({id:1,href:'/sum/docs/procedural_topics/2.confessions_rule_right_to_silence_and_right_to_counsel/',title:"2. Confessions Rule, Right to Silence, and Right to Counsel",section:"Procedural Topics",content:"Confessions Summary #  Preliminary Considerations: #  Was the accused\u0026rsquo;s statement a confession or \u0026lsquo;res gestae\u0026rsquo;?\nRes gestae statements are those made spontaneously, during or soon after an offence takes place.\nAt common law, they are admissible and an exception to the voluntariness rule.\nWhere police obtain a statement from the accused that is not res gestae, the accused may challenge its admissibility on the basis that it was obtained contrary to (a) the common law Confessions Rule,\n(b) the Charter: s. 7 (silence), 10(a/b), 11(c)(compulsion), 13 (incrimination); or\n(c) if the accused were aged 12 to 17, section 146 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.\n 1. The Common Law Confessions Rule: #  At common law, a confession or statement made to a person in authority is inadmissible unless the Crown can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was made voluntarily. (Boudreau)\nR v Oickle (SCC 2000) is now the leading authority on voluntariness of confessions, consolidating earlier law into a two-stage test.1 The court should ask:\ni. Where a statement was obtained involving the use of police trickery\u0026ndash;regardless of whether the statement was made to a Person in Authority (PIA)\u0026ndash;would the police conduct \u0026ldquo;shock the community\u0026rdquo;? If yes, the statement is involuntary; if not:\nii. Apply a \u0026ldquo;general voluntariness analysis,\u0026rdquo; asking whether the Crown has proved, BARD, that a statement made to a PIA was voluntary, in the sense that:\na. the accused\u0026rsquo;s will was not overborne by one or more strong inducements, or a significant degree of oppression (or a combination thereof), and\nb. the accused did not lack an operating mind.\n -the emphasis at the first stage of the test (community shock) is less on voluntariness than on maintaining the integrity of the criminal justice system. Trickery can raise a doubt about voluntariness, but it may not and can still \u0026ldquo;shock the community,\u0026rdquo; resulting in the exclusion of the confession. (Oickle)\n-at the second stage of the test, the court should consider all of the factors together to assess whether the statement was made voluntarily beyond a reasonable doubt. (Oickle)\n-one or more strong threats or inducements alone or in combination with other factors could raise a reasonable doubt about voluntariness. (Oickle)\n-in assessing whether the \u0026lsquo;operating mind\u0026rsquo; test (defined below) has been met, the court should consider all the circumstances, including oppression, inducements, and trickery. (Oickle)\n-a failure for the Crown at either stage of the test results in the exclusion of evidence (i.e., no 24(2)).\n-a threat or inducement need not be overt; the question of whether an inducement has been made turns on whether there has been a quid pro quo. (Oickle)\n-by virtue of requiring a strong inducement or a significant degree of oppression, the CL rule permits some degree of trickery, oppression and/or inducements (i.e., up to the point at which a reasonable doubt about voluntariness is raised). (Oickle)\n-oppressive circumstances include: being deprived of food, water, sleep; being denied access to counsel; being presented with fabricated evidence; or being questioned aggressively at length. (Oickle)\n-the standard for \u0026ldquo;operating mind\u0026rdquo; is low: the accused must have \u0026ldquo;known what she is saying and that it may be used by the police to her detriment.\u0026rdquo; (Oickle, Whittle)\n-to be clear: under the \u0026lsquo;general voluntariness analysis\u0026rsquo; in Oickle, to find a statement involuntary, the trier of fact need not conclude that the accused\u0026rsquo;s will was overborne (by one or more strong inducements, etc\u0026hellip;), but only that there was a reasonable possibility that it was.\nWho is a \u0026lsquo;person in authority\u0026rsquo;? #  In Grandinetti, the SCC held: \u0026ldquo;The operative question is whether the accused, based on his or her [reasonable] perception of the recipient\u0026rsquo;s ability to influence the prosecution, believed either that refusing to make a statement to the person would result in prejudice, or that making one would result in favourable treatment\u0026rdquo;.\nA PIA is someone \u0026ldquo;formally engaged in the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of the accused\u0026rdquo; and would include police officers and prison officials or guards. (Hodgson)\nA PIA may also include \u0026ldquo;persons whom the accused reasonably believes are acting on behalf of the state and could therefore influence or control the proceedings against him or her.\u0026rdquo; (Hodgson)\nWhether someone is a PIA is assessed both subjectively and objectively: what did the accused believe or perceive, and was that belief or perception reasonable? (Rothman, Grandinetti)\nUndercover officers are generally not PIA\u0026rsquo;s. (Rothman, Grandinetti)\n2. The Right to Counsel under Section 10(b) of the Charter: #  Section 10(b) of the Charter states that \u0026ldquo;[e]veryone has the right on arrest or detention [\u0026hellip;] to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to informed of that right\u0026rdquo;.  The purpose of this right is to provide a person the information necessary to make an informed choice as to whether to speak to or cooperate with authorities. The interests it is meant to protect are dignity and personal autonomy. (Clarkson, Brydges, and Sinclair)\nWhere a person may have been subject to a form of non-legal psychological compulsion amounting to detention, the court would apply the test for detention in Grant. (Put another way: to decide whether a person was detained when they gave a statement that should have been preceded by 10(a) and (b), a court would apply the test in Grant, which defines detention for both sections 9 and 10.)\nTo validly discharge their duty under section 10(b), police, on arrest or detention, have a duty to fulfill an information and implementation component, with each comprising a set of subsidiary duties:2\n To fulfill the information component, police must:  a. advise the person that they have a right to \u0026ldquo;retain and instruct\u0026rdquo; (consult) counsel without delay;\nb. advise of the availability of legal aid or free duty counsel and provide numbers; (Brydges, Bartle)\n[then, if the person expresses a will to exercise the right\u0026mdash;or does not explicitly or impliedly waive the right (and the waiver is valid, see below), police must aid in implementing 10(b)]\nTo fulfill the implementation component, police must:  a. provide a suspect with a reasonable opportunity to speak to either counsel of choice or duty counsel, in private (this includes providing them with access to a phone in a private space);\nb. do so without delay (unless there are urgent circumstances);\nand\nc. hold off on questioning or eliciting evidence until the suspect has had a reasonable opportunity to speak to a lawyer. (Manninen, Brydges)\n Police are not obligated to suspend the search incident to arrest until the detainee has the opportunity to retain counsel. (Debot)\nThe burden is on the Crown to show that a delay in implementing 10(b) was reasonable in the circumstances. (Taylor)\nHowever, an accused must be \u0026ldquo;reasonably diligent\u0026rdquo; in their exercise of 10(b) or it lapses. An accused cannot use the opportunity to contact counsel to stall. If they cannot reach counsel of choice after reasonable efforts are made over a reasonable period of time, they must settle with duty counsel (if available). (Smith, Ross)\nA valid waiver of 10(b) is one that is (a) \u0026ldquo;clear and unequivocal\u0026rdquo; and (b) made when the person is \u0026ldquo;fully aware of the consequences of waiving the right.\u0026rdquo; (Clarkson; Brydges)\nA person may impliedly waive 10(b), but the waiver must be clear and unequivocal, and it must be informed\u0026mdash;i.e., the person must be clear about the availability of free duty counsel, and the waiver may not be premised on a misapprehension that a desire to exercise 10(b) is itself incriminating. (Brydges)\nThe waiver of 10(b) by an extremely drunk suspect may be challenged as equivocal; he or she must be given time to sober up and warned about 10(b) again. While waiting, police must abstain from questioning. (Clarkson)\nThe state has no obligation under 10(b) to make duty counsel available after business hours, but where an accused expresses a desire to exercise 10(b) and duty counsel is not available (and no other counsel is made available to them), police must hold off on questioning or eliciting evidence from the person until they have had a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel. (Prosper)\nWhere a person expresses a desire to exercise 10(b) and is diligent in the exercise of the right but cannot reach counsel (of choice or duty counsel), a waiver of 10(b) at that time will not be valid unless police provide a \u0026lsquo;Prosper warning':\n Police in this case must, once again, advise the detainee of \u0026ldquo;her right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and of the obligation on the part of the police during this time not to take any statements or require the detainee to participate in any potentially incriminating process until she has had that reasonable opportunity.\u0026rdquo; (Prosper)\n Where an accused person\u0026rsquo;s consultation with counsel is brief, or otherwise raises concerns, the accused has the onus of promptly and/or diligently raising this with police. Police do not have a duty to inquire into the adequacy of advice provided to an accused. (Willier)\nA person does not have a right to consult counsel again unless there is a material change in circumstances (e.g., a change in investigative procedure or jeopardy), or unless there is reason to believe the first opportunity to consult was inadequate. (Sinclair)\nIf the reason for the arrest or detention itself changes, a person must also be given their 10(a) and (b) warnings again. (Borden; Sinclair)\nSuspects do not have a right under 10(b) of the Charter to have counsel present throughout an in-custody police interrogation.3 (Sinclair)\n3. The Right to Silence under the Charter: #  Section 7 of the Charter states:\n \u0026ldquo;Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\u0026rdquo;\n  The SCC in Hebert held that section 7 protects the right to silence by virtue of the Court\u0026rsquo;s recognition in that case that it is a \u0026lsquo;principle of fundamental justice\u0026rsquo; that a person will not be deprived of their liberty in violation of the right to silence.\nThe purpose of the right is to protect a person\u0026rsquo;s ability to make a free choice about to whether to speak to or cooperate with authorities. The right protects an interest in dignity and autonomy. (Hebert)\nAn accused\u0026rsquo;s right to silence applies any time he or she interacts with a person in authority, whether detained or not. (Turcotte)\nTest for breach of right to silence #  In Hebert, the Court held that the right to silence is breached where an accused can establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he or she:\ni. lacked an operating mind; or\nii. police conduct \u0026ldquo;effectively and unfairly deprived\u0026rdquo; him or her from exercising a free choice to speak to authorities. (Most commonly: through persistent, aggressive questioning or the use of UC officer in detention who actively elicits information.)\n Where an accused has consulted counsel and expresses the will to remain silent, police may still question him or her. (Hebert, Singh)\nThe fact that police continue to question a suspect despite repeated assertions of the will to remain silent does not violate the right to silence. (Singh)\nContinuous questioning in the face of an express will to remain silent, alone or combined with other circumstances, may\n(a) amount to proof on a balance of probabilities that the right to silence has been violated by virtue of the police having vitiated the suspect\u0026rsquo;s exercise of free choice about whether to speak; and/or\n(b) raise a reasonable doubt about whether the statement was made voluntarily (under the common law confessions rule); and/or\n(c) raise a reasonable doubt about the veracity of the statement. (Singh)\nWhere an accused exercises the right to counsel, expresses the desire to remain silent, and is held in police custody, police may seek to obtain evidence through the use of an undercover officer or informant acting at the direction of the police.

Search and Seizure",section:"Procedural Topics",content:"Search and Seizure Summary #  Preliminary points: #  Section 8 of the Charter states:\n\u0026ldquo;[e]veryone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.\u0026rdquo;\n In Hunter v Southam, the Supreme Court held that the purpose of section 8 is to protect a person\u0026rsquo;s right to a \u0026ldquo;reasonable expectation of privacy\u0026rdquo; (REP).\nA person\u0026rsquo;s rights under section 8 are only engaged where the search by a state agent intrudes upon an REP. (Hunter) (See below for more on REP.)\nA \u0026lsquo;search\u0026rsquo; under section 8 is anything done as an \u0026lsquo;investigative technique\u0026rsquo; or with an investigative purpose. (Evans, SCC 1996)\nWhere a state agent carries out a search impinging upon an REP, the court asks whether the search was reasonable. The Supreme Court in Collins held that a search will be reasonable under s. 8 if:\n(i) it is authorized by law,\n(ii) the law is reasonable, and\n(iii) the search is carried out in a reasonable manner.\n Requirements of a \u0026lsquo;reasonable\u0026rsquo; search: #  In Hunter, the Supreme Court held a reasonable search is one conducted pursuant to a warrant (or prior authorization), issued by an independent party acting judicially, on the standard of reasonable and probable grounds (i.e., reasonable grounds to believe an offence has been committed and evidence is likely to be found in the place to be searched).1\nThe Court in Hunter also held that a warrantless search is prima facie unreasonable, but it may still be reasonable under section 8 in some circumstances.\nA warrantless search may be reasonable if the Crown can demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that it was carried out pursuant to other law, the law is reasonable, and the search is carried out in a reasonable manner. (Collins)\nOther law authorizing a search includes:\n -statutory or common law authority on exigent circumstances;\n-other statutory provisions (e.g., allowing for searches without warrants and/or on lesser grounds in regulatory contexts); or\n-other common law (e.g., ancillary police powers, sniffer dog searches, valid consent.)\n To assess whether a (new) law authorizing a search is \u0026lsquo;reasonable\u0026rsquo;, the court asks whether it strikes an appropriate balance between the state interest in search in that context and the privacy interest at issue. (Hunter)\n Dickson J indicated in Hunter that in a context in which the state has a heightened interest in search and a person\u0026rsquo;s EP is relatively low and the form of search authorized is not highly invasive, it may be reasonable to depart from the 3 requirements in Hunter\u0026mdash;and to allow, for example, for a warrantless search on a standard lower than RPG.\nConversely, where the EP is extremely high, as in a strip search, section 8 may require a standard higher than RPG to believe that evidence will be found (e.g., for strip searches, the additional belief that the search is necessary for safety or to preserve evidence from imminent loss: Golden).\n The third part of Collins asks whether the practical, physical manner in which the search was carried out was reasonable.2\nNotable exceptions to the Hunter requirements #  The SCC has recognized as reasonable various departures from the Hunter standards\u0026mdash;in light of a lower privacy interest or a greater state interest in the context, or both: including\n -the \u0026ldquo;ancillary police power\u0026rdquo; at common law to carry out a:\n-search incident to arrest (without additional grounds);\n-search incident to investigative detention (on reasonable suspicion of safety concerns),\n-a sniffer-dog search in a public space of odors emanating from a sealed item (on reasonable suspicion) (Kang-Brown, A.M.; Mackenzie);3\n*-*a \u0026lsquo;safety search\u0026rsquo; (of a residence, a car) where police have reasonable and probable grounds to believe there is an imminent threat to public or police safety and the search is necessary to eliminate the threat (MacDonald).4\n-statutory provisions allow for warrantless searches in exigent circumstances: 487.11 of the Criminal Code and 11(7) of the CDSA: both provisions state that a PO can carry out a warrantless search if the conditions for obtaining a warrant under 487(1) or 11(1) exist but due to exigent circumstances it is not practicable to obtain a warrant.\nThe SCC in Grant (1993), considering 11(7), held that: \u0026ldquo;Exigent circumstances will generally be held to exist if there is an imminent danger of the loss, removal, destruction or disappearance of the evidence if the search or seizure is delayed.\u0026rdquo; In Paterson (2017), the SCC added that exigent circs in 11(7) \u0026ldquo;denotes not merely convenience\u0026hellip; but rather urgency\u0026rdquo; to act to preserve evidence or for officer or public safety.\n When do we have a REP? #  The SCC has set out several tests for REP, among them the following three (the first being the most general and authoritative).\nThe test set out in Spencer (2014) and Marakah (2017):\n Whether a person has an REP in a thing/place depends on the \u0026ldquo;totality of the circumstances,\u0026rdquo; to be assessed under four \u0026ldquo;lines of inquiry\u0026rdquo;:\nWhat was the subject matter of the alleged search? [a space, object, conversation, device]\nDid the claimant have a direct interest in the subject matter? [ownership, direct involvement]\nDid the claimant have a subjective expectation of privacy in the subject matter?\nIf so, was the claimant\u0026rsquo;s subjective expectation of privacy objectively reasonable?5\n A second test, relating primarily to \u0026ldquo;informational\u0026rdquo; forms of privacy, involves an assessment of whether the thing being searched reveals a \u0026ldquo;biographical core of personal information,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;information which tends to reveal intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the individual.\u0026rdquo; (Plant)\nA third test, set out in Wong holds that whether we have an REP in a place / thing depends in a general sense on \u0026ldquo;whether, by the standards of privacy that persons can expect to enjoy in a free and democratic society, the agents of the state were bound to conform to the requirements of the Charter when effecting the intrusion in question.\u0026rdquo; (Wong) The question is thus normative rather than descriptive.\nAn item or place used for an illicit purpose does not preclude finding an REP in it. (Wong)6\nSearch analysis in a conventional criminal case: #  When assessing the validity of a search, courts apply the following framework:\ni. Did the accused have an REP in the place or thing searched/seized?\n (Section 8 only protects a place or thing over which we have an REP: Hunter)\n[Onus on the accused on a balance of probabilities.]\n ii. Was the search reasonable?\n Pursuant to Collins, a search under s 8 is reasonable if:\n i. it was authorized by law\nii. the law is reasonable (in the sense of striking an appropriate balance between the state\u0026rsquo;s interest in search in this context and the privacy interest at stake); and\niii. the search was carried out in a reasonable manner.\n [Onus on the Crown on all 3 points here on a balance of probabilities.]\n Search pursuant to a warrant #  A search conducted with a warrant will be one \u0026ldquo;authorized by law\u0026rdquo; only if the warrant was validly issued (i.e., in conformity with the requirements of the statutory provision) and the search conformed to the scope of the warrant?7\nIf a home (or any other space) were searched without a warrant, the search would be prima facie unreasonable and might still be reasonable (applying the test in Collins).\nWarrantless search #  A warrantless search might be \u0026lsquo;authorized by law\u0026rsquo; under:\n a. a search power set out in a statute or at common law;8\nb. exigent circumstances [Code 487.11, 529.3, etc.]; or\nc. valid consent.9\n If there was no authority for the search, or if the search does not conform to any authority, the search was unreasonable and violates section 8.\nIf there was other authority for the search and the search conforms with it (and the law / authority in question is reasonable: Collins 2), the court would then ask whether the search was carried out in a reasonable manner? (Collins 3)\nIf it was, the search was reasonable and does not violate section 8; if not, the search was unreasonable and violates section 8.\n(Where section 8 has been breached, the court then moves on to the question of exclusion under section 24(2) of the Charter \u0026ndash; but do this on an exam only if asked!)\n  Section 487 of the Criminal Code and section 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act set out provisions for authorizing a warrant in criminal cases, and these have been held to conform to the Hunter requirements. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Examples of authorized searches carried out unreasonably include a strip search of a woman in the middle of a busy restaurant by three male officers; a case where officers have a warrant to search a residence and use a \u0026ldquo;hard\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dynamic\u0026rdquo; entry method rather than knocking, not because they have safety concerns but because of a blanket policy by the policy force in question (see, eg, R v Cornell); and the case of Collins itself, where the officer had grounds for the search of the accused but lunged at the accused, applying excessive force. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Where police may use sniffer-dogs is to be determined case by case: MacKenzie. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n A distinct search power not premised on detention or arrest. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n A negative answer to any one of the four lines of inquiry would result in a finding of no REP.

Wiretap and Surveillance",section:"Procedural Topics",content:"Overview of wiretap and electronic surveillance #  Preliminary points #  The Supreme Court held in Duarte and Wong that where police record a private conversation, they carry out a search. Part VI of the Code contains an extensive scheme for authorizing surveillance by state agents, though there are provisions in other parts of the Code allowing for other forms of surveillance or electronic monitoring (discussed below).\nPart VI of the Code has three features.\nSection 184(1) of the Code makes it an offence to \u0026lsquo;intercept\u0026rsquo; or eavesdrop on a \u0026lsquo;private communication\u0026rsquo; between other people with a device.\nSection 184(2) sets out exceptions to the offence, allowing for ‘interceptions’ with a device in certain cases – including with consent or with authorization.\nThird, Part VI provides three kinds of authorization: ‘full-blown’ third-party interceptions; consent interceptions; and emergency interceptions.\nThe interceptions provided for in warrants under Part VI are for listening to or recording oral communications with a device. A warrant for video surveillance is available in section 487.01(4) – though, as discussed below, section 487.01(5) incorporates the same limitations and requirements of Part VI authorizations.\nImportant terms #  Section 183 defines \u0026lsquo;private communication\u0026rsquo; as an oral communication or a \u0026lsquo;telecommunication\u0026rsquo; [a term defined in the Interpretation Act to be anything transmitted by an \u0026lsquo;electromagnetic system\u0026rsquo;] by or to a person in Canada where the originator reasonably expects that it will not be received by anyone other than their intended recipient.\nSection 183 also defines \u0026lsquo;interception\u0026rsquo; to mean record or listen.\n -thus, if you were simply eavesdropping on a conversation in the next room, by pressing our ear to the door, you would not be committing the offence under s. 184 \u0026ndash; though you might be committing the tort of \u0026lsquo;invasion of privacy\u0026rsquo; under section 1 of the Privacy Act, BC.\nSection 184 requires an interception (listening or recording) with a device.\n Interception with a device: #  Section 184(2) of the Code sets out a series of exceptions to the offence in 184(1). The two most important are:\n i. when a person has the consent of one of the parties to the conversation intercepted\nii. with authorization\n[Other exceptions are for telecom companies maintaining the system.]\n Can police get around the need for an \u0026lsquo;authorization\u0026rsquo; in order to lawfully conduct an interception (record or listen) if they have consent from one party? Yes and no.\nPolice can rely only on consent if they only want to listen with a device. If they want to record, they need authorization.\n (What about if police only want to listen without a device? The BCCA has held that if police eavesdrop on a private conversation \u0026mdash; deliberately \u0026mdash; they carry out a search [Sandhu, 1993]. They would therefore need to be authorized by law to do this: a warrant or other authority.)\n If police want to record a private conversation the provisions of this part of the Code require, in some cases, that police have authorization with consent, and in some cases, only authorization.\nAuthorization #  Section 183 defines \u0026lsquo;authorization\u0026rsquo; in this part of the Code to include various provisions allowing for interceptions, but they fall within 3 categories:\n i. 184.2(1) \u0026mdash; allows for police interception if they have a warrant and consent.

The seriousness of the Charter-infringing conduct;\n -was the police/state conduct inadvertent or minor?\n-was it reckless or deliberate? (negligence is not to be equated with good faith)\n-where there extenuating circumstances (such as a need to preserve evidence)?\n-was the conduct part of a pattern of abuse?\n-would the admission of the evidence bring admin of justice into disrepute by sending the message that courts condone this conduct by failing to disassociate from it?\n(The more severe or deliberate the conduct, the greater the need to disassociate from it \u0026ndash; favouring exclusion.)\n ii. The impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused;\n -what interests are engaged by the right in question?\n(i.e., for s. 8: privacy, personal integrity, and security; for s. 7 and 10(b), the right to silence, the principle against self-incrimination, etc.)\n-how serious was the violation of that interest?\n(The more serious the incursion, the greater the risk that admission will bring the administration of justice into disrepute, favouring exclusion.)\n iii. The impact of exclusion on society\u0026rsquo;s interests in the adjudication of the case on its merits.\n -to assess this court must ask: \u0026ldquo;Would the truth-seeking function of the trial process be better served by admission or by its exclusion?\u0026rdquo;\n-factors to consider:\n-does the Charter breach undermine the reliability of the evidence (or is it real evidence?)\n-is the evidence essential to the Crown\u0026rsquo;s case?\n-the more reliable and relevant the evidence, the more it would favour admission.\n-the seriousness of the offence is to be considered but is not thought to clearly favour admission or exclusion (there is a risk of disrepute when excluding evidence in the case of a serious offence, but also a risk of disrepute arising from conviction resting on faulty evidence). The test under 24(2) should not become a balancing between the seriousness of the breach and the seriousness of the offence.\n -the Supreme Court in Harrison held:\n \u0026ldquo;The balancing exercise mandated by s. 24(2) is a qualitative one, not capable of mathematical precision. It is not simply a question of whether the majority of the relevant factors favour exclusion in a particular case. The evidence on each line of inquiry must be weighed in the balance, to determine whether, having regard to all the circumstances, admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.\u0026rdquo;  -See Professor Ferguson\u0026rsquo;s chart summarizing different kinds of evidence or cases and the likely outcome of the 24(2) analysis (as set out in Grant).

Actus Reus",section:"Substantive Topics",content:"Summary of law on Actus Reus #  General points on actus reus: #  The actus reus can be defined as \u0026ldquo;a physically voluntary act or omission.\u0026rdquo;\nFor an offence to be committed, the actus reus and mens rea must be concurrent\u0026mdash;on the principle that if not, courts would punish either conduct without fault or guilty intent not expressed in guilty action.\nThe actus reus of an offence must be carried out voluntarily and can include the failure to act.\nThe principle of legality requires that the actus reus for a criminal offence is set out in an offence (enacted and published) at the time it was committed, and that the definition of the offence not be overbroad or vague. (The principle is partially entrenched in 11(g) of the Charter.)\nThe Principle of Concurrency: #  As a general principle, the actus reus and mens rea must concur. (Fagan, Cooper)\nThey need not be \u0026ldquo;completely concurrent\u0026rdquo; throughout the commission of an offence but must coincide \u0026ldquo;at some point.\u0026rdquo; (Cooper)\nCourts may take an expansive view of when the actus reus is completed: a \u0026ldquo;series of acts [or omissions] may form part of the same transaction.\u0026rdquo; (Cooper)\nAn act (or an omission) carried out unintentionally at first can be \u0026ldquo;adopted\u0026rdquo; by a later decision not to act to rectify it. If an act is continuous, a person\u0026rsquo;s adoption of an earlier omission or unintentional act will constitute a concurrence of the actus reus and mens rea. (Miller)\nVoluntariness: #  The actus reus must be committed voluntarily. (Kilbride, King)\nVoluntariness entails \u0026ldquo;conscious control of action\u0026rdquo; or action that is the \u0026ldquo;product of conscious choice.\u0026rdquo; This is premised on the belief that it would be unfair and unjust to punish persons for conduct they did not choose or could not physically control. (Kilbride, King)\nAt common law, \u0026ldquo;a person is presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of their actions.\u0026rdquo; Thus, where an accused carries out a basic act, forming one or more elements of the actus reus\u0026mdash;for example, pushing or punching another person\u0026mdash;he or she is presumed to have acted voluntarily. (Bernard, Daviault)\nAn accused may raise a doubt about whether she acted voluntarily by adducing evidence that, at the time of the offence, she was affected by mental or physical disorders or conditions, including sleepwalking, concussion, delirium, epileptic seizure, or involuntary intoxication.\nThe concept of voluntariness in Canadian criminal law refers to choice and control over physical actions. In Ruzic, the SCC recognized that acts carried out under necessity or duress are \u0026ldquo;morally involuntary.\u0026rdquo; The Court in Ruzic and Hibbert also held that, in contrast to physical involuntariness, moral involuntariness does not negate the actus reus or the mens rea. It may, however, excuse the acts (if the elements of the defence of necessity or duress are made out), thus resulting in an acquittal.\nOmissions: #  A failure to act can form the basis of criminal liability only where the failure constitutes the breach of a legal duty to act.\nThere is no general legal duty in Canadian criminal law to be a good Samaritan: i.e., to assist someone in distress, or prevent a crime from occurring or continuing\u0026mdash;even when one can do so easily and without risk or disadvantage.\nA number of Code provisions criminalize omissions on the basis of duties set out in the offence provision itself\u0026mdash;for example, section 129(b): failing to assist a police officer when requested, or section 252(1): failing to stop, give ID, and render assistance after being involved in an accident.\nOther offence provisions include as part of the actus reus the breach of a legal duty set out elsewhere in the law: e.g.,\n -s. 180(2) \u0026ndash; common nuisance: \u0026ldquo;Everyone commits a common nuisance who does an unlawful act or fails to discharge a legal duty and thereby (a) endangers lives, safety, health, property or comfort of the public \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n-s. 220 \u0026ndash; criminal negligence causing death. This offence draws on the definition of criminal negligence in 219:\n(1) Everyone is criminally negligent who\n (a) in doing anything, or\n (b) in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do,\nshows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.\n(2) For the purposes of this section, \u0026ldquo;duty\u0026rdquo; means a duty imposed by law.\n The Code itself contains provisions that set out legal duties that can be applied under sections 180 or 219, including:\n -s. 216 \u0026ndash; setting out a duty of persons to use reasonable care in undertaking acts that may endanger life.\n-s. 217 \u0026ndash; stating: \u0026ldquo;Everyone who undertakes to do an act is under a legal duty to do it if an omission to do the act is or may be dangerous to life.\u0026rdquo;\n The Ontario Court of Appeal in Thornton held that the legal duty referred to in section 180(2) can be found in either federal or provincial statutes or at common law. It also held that a valid duty in this context is the one set out in Donoghue v. Stevenson to \u0026ldquo;take reasonable care not to injure one\u0026rsquo;s neighbour.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal in Brown held that for the purposes of section 217, an \u0026ldquo;undertaking\u0026rdquo; requires a commitment to do something that is \u0026ldquo;clearly made and with binding intent.\u0026rdquo; The \u0026ldquo;mere expression of words indicating a willingness to act\u0026rdquo; will not suffice.\nConsequences and Causation: #  General points:\nWhere the actus reus of an offence includes the element of causation (\u0026ldquo;dangerous driving causing death\u0026rdquo;), the Crown must prove causation BARD.\nIf the accused\u0026rsquo;s actions are the direct or main cause (i.e., the factual cause), then causation is made out. No need to go further.\nBut if the accused\u0026rsquo;s actions are only a contributing cause, the court must consider whether those actions are the \u0026lsquo;legal cause.\u0026rsquo; The test for legal causation is whether the actions of the accused were a \u0026ldquo;contributing cause beyond the de minimus\u0026quot;. (Smithers)\nLegal causation refers to a person\u0026rsquo;s moral responsibility for a prohibited consequence where his or her acts were a significant cause but not necessarily the only or main cause. (Smithers, Nette)\nTest for legal causation: #  The test for legal causation in criminal law was reformulated in Nette: the act at issue must be \u0026ldquo;a significant contributing cause.\u0026rdquo; The majority of the SCC in Nette held that this was a preferable way of formulating the same (or equally acceptable) test set out earlier in Smithers (\u0026ldquo;a contributing cause beyond the de minimus\u0026quot;).\nLegal and factual causes may be distinct, with the accused\u0026rsquo;s acts forming only one of two or more operative causes. (Smithers, Harbottle)\nThe accused\u0026rsquo;s conduct therefore need not be the \u0026ldquo;sole cause,\u0026rdquo; the \u0026ldquo;main cause,\u0026rdquo; or even a \u0026ldquo;substantial cause\u0026rdquo; in order to be the legal cause. (Smithers)\nIntervening acts\nAn intervening act may interrupt the causal chain between the accused and the harm inflicted, raising a reasonable doubt about whether the accused\u0026rsquo;s original act was a \u0026lsquo;significant contributing cause.\u0026rsquo; (Harbottle, Maybin)\nThe SCC in Maybin held that courts may consider one or both of two possible \u0026lsquo;lines of inquiry\u0026rsquo; to assess whether an intervening act or event severs the causal link between the accused\u0026rsquo;s actions and the consequence at issue (or raises a doubt about this):\n  was the event reasonably foreseeable from the act of the accused \u0026ndash; not the specific act, but the general nature of it; and/or\n  was the event a response to the accused\u0026rsquo;s act or was it an independent, intentional act that overwhelmed the act of the accused?\n  (The Court also held that the main test remains the one in Smithers/Nette.)\n The Smithers/Nette test applies to all offences, including manslaughter and murder, with the exception of \u0026lsquo;constructive\u0026rsquo; first-degree murder under sections 231(5) and (6) noted below (or unless the offence provision provides otherwise).\nThe requirement to establish causation is a principle of fundamental justice under section 7 of the Charter, as part of the broader principle that the morally innocent should not be punished.\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal has held that the Smithers' de minimus test does not offend fundamental justice by setting too low a threshold for proof of causation, given the fact that for more serious crimes such as manslaughter, the Crown must also establish objective foreseeability of a risk of bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory. (Cribben)\nCausation and murder: #  For the forms of first-degree murder set out in sections 231(5) and (6) (or where similar terms are used), the test for causation is whether the accused\u0026rsquo;s conduct was \u0026ldquo;a substantial and integral cause of death\u0026rdquo;. (Harbottle, Nette)\nFor all other forms of murder (i.e., first and second degree), the test for causation is the one set out in Smithers/Nette.\n"}),a.add({id:6,href:'/sum/docs/substantive_topics/1b.-mens_rea/',title:"1b. Mens Rea",section:"Substantive Topics",content:"Summary of law on Mens Rea #  General points on mens rea: #  There is no single kind or level of fault that applies to all criminal or regulatory offences.\nThe Supreme Court has held that it is a principle of fundamental justice under section 7 of the Charter that a person should not be convicted of a criminal offence without the Crown having to prove a fault element, and one that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence. (Creighton)\nSection 7 does not therefore require that a conviction for a criminal offence rest on proof of subjective mens rea. It requires proof of a fault element, and the fault element need only attach to a blameworthy element of the actus reus. For most crimes, objective mens rea is constitutionally sufficient, so long as it is commensurate to the gravity of the offence. (DeSousa, Creighton)\n\u0026lsquo;Special stigma crimes\u0026rsquo; are a partial exception. The Court has identified a category of offences to be \u0026lsquo;special stigma\u0026rsquo; offences, based on their stigma and penalty. In Vaillancourt, the Court held that it is a principle of fundamental justice that a person cannot be convicted of such an offence without proof of \u0026ldquo;a mens rea reflecting the particular nature of the crime.\u0026rdquo; For theft: proof of dishonesty; for murder: proof of subjective foresight of death.\nIn the case of a negligence-based criminal offence, section 7 requires proof of the accused\u0026rsquo;s failure to be aware of a risk arising from conduct amounting to a marked departure from the standard of the reasonable person. (Creighton)\nSection 7 requires that any offence that may result in a deprivation of liberty (jail, probation) cannot be an absolute liability offence. A regulatory offence with penal consequences must either require proof of fault or allow for proof of a lack of fault (as in strict liability). (BC Motor Vehicle Reference)\nCommon law presumptions about the fault element: #  Where an offence provision is silent on mens rea, the common law presumes that a certain level of fault is required, depending on whether the offence is criminal or regulatory in nature.\n-an offence can be inferred to be \u0026ldquo;criminal\u0026rdquo; where it:\n -carries a serious penalty or stigma; and/or\n-absolutely prohibits and punishes inherently wrongful conduct.\n -an offence can be inferred to be \u0026ldquo;regulatory\u0026rdquo; where it:\n -appears in either a provincial or federal statute;\n-its predominant purpose is the regulation of a risk or the prevention of harm to public welfare through the requirement to abide by a minimum standard of care or conduct; and\n-carries a relatively low penalty and stigma (i.e., a jail sentence of roughly 3 years or less)\n(Beaver, Pierce, Sault Ste. Marie, Wholesale Travel)\n Offences in the Criminal Code are presumed to be criminal. (Prue, Buzzanga) The same presumption arguably extends to offences in other criminal law statutes such as the CDSA and the YCJA.\nIf an offence is a criminal offence and is silent as to mens rea, there is a presumption at common law that the offence requires the Crown to prove a subjective form of mens rea (intent, knowledge, willful blindness or recklessness) for each element of the actus reus. (Sault Ste. Marie, Buzzanga, R v ADH [SCC 2013])\nIn the case of offences (aside from murder) that include aggravated assault, unlawful act causing bodily harm and unlawful act manslaughter, the Supreme Court has held that a distinct fault element may attach to the assault or unlawful act (subjective or objective mens rea, as the case may be), but the fault element in relation to the prohibited consequence (bodily harm, death, etc.) may be as low as \u0026lsquo;objective foreseeability of non-trivial harm.\u0026rsquo; (DeSousa, Creighton)\nIf the offence is a criminal offence, the burden rests on the Crown to prove the requisite mens rea.\nWhere an offence is a regulatory offence and is silent as to the requisite fault element, there is a presumption that it is a strict liability offence. In this case, the Crown is required to prove only the actus reus BARD and negligence is inferred from this in the absence of proof on the part of the accused (on a balance of probabilities) that he or she took reasonable care to avoid the prohibited consequence. (Sault Ste. Marie)\nNot all regulatory offences are either strict or absolute liability. There is a presumption that regulatory offences are strict liability where the offence provision is silent as to mens rea. There is a further presumption that an offence is one of absolutely liability only where Parliament or the legislature makes this intention clear through either explicit language or other indications, such as subject matter or context (regulatory, minor penalty, no stigma). However, Parliament and provincial legislatures can also create a regulatory offence that requires the Crown to prove a mens rea element, either subjective or objective (e.g., knowledge, intent, reasonable foreseeability, etc.) by including language to this effect. (Sault Ste. Marie, Stasser)\nHierarchy of forms of mens rea or fault: #  1. full or subjective MR\n2. objective foresight or knowledge (the accused ought to have known a consequence would follow)\n3. criminal negligence (occurs only where offence is pursuant to ss. 219, 220, or 221)\n4. penal negligence (criminal offence involving a departure from a standard: e.g., careless use of a firearm)\n5. strict liability (Crown proves AR, accused may establish defence of due diligence or incapacity)\n6. absolute liability (Crown proves AR, no fault necessary)\n Subjective mens rea: #  If a criminal offence contains a specific term or phrase such as \u0026ldquo;with intent,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;wilfully,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;knowingly,\u0026rdquo; etc., this will generally exclude lower forms of mens rea. For example, a provision requiring that a prohibited consequence be committed intentionally, willfully, or on purpose will exclude knowledge, wilful blindness, or recklessness as alternate forms of mens rea. (Buzzanga; Chartrand, SCC 1994)\nWhere a provision requires the proof of intention or wilfulness, the Crown may prove this by establishing either:\n i. direct intent: i.e., that the accused consciously or deliberately intended to bring about the prohibited consequence.\n(For example, in the offence of \u0026lsquo;wilfully promoting hatred\u0026rsquo;: a person intends to communicate and also directly/explicitly intends for his communication to promote hatred)\nii. indirect intent: i.e., that the accused intended to do one thing but subjectively foresaw that a prohibited consequence was certain or substantially certain to follow from it.1\n(For example, communicating something that is substantially certain to promote hatred \u0026ndash; here a person may intend only to communicate something satirical, but where he also foresees that it is substantially certain to promote hatred as well, he is deemed to have intended to promote hatred too, even though his immediate intention might only have been to communicate a satirical message.)\n In both cases the accused will be found to have intended the prohibited consequence. (Buzzanga)\nWhere an offence requires that something be done \u0026lsquo;for the purpose\u0026rsquo; of achieving a prohibited result, the Crown need only prove that a person acted intentionally or deliberately in effecting that result. The Crown need not prove that the person also desired it. Conversely, where a person carries out a certain act deliberately but does not desire that it be done (killing, assault, etc.), she does not thereby negate the intentional character of her act (but she may rely on the defence of duress). (Hibbert)\nRecklessness is a subjective form of mens rea in which a person is aware of a risk (of a prohibited result) but decides to take it. (Sansregret)\nWilful blindness is a form of mens rea in which a person becomes aware of the need for some inquiry but declines to make it (or is \u0026ldquo;deliberately ignorant\u0026rdquo;). (Sansregret, Duong, Briscoe)\nWB requires a strong suspicion of a prohibited consequence, combined with a deliberate choice not to inquire so as to avoid being fixed with knowledge. The fault lies not in failing to inquire but choosing not to when a strong suspicion is aroused. (Briscoe)\nWherever knowledge is an element of the fault component for an offence, wilful blindness may substitute. (Briscoe)\nIf wilful blindness substitutes for the knowledge element in a charge of murder it requires \u0026ndash; for either the principal or the party \u0026ndash; not just a \u0026lsquo;strong suspicion of a prohibited consequence\u0026rsquo; but awareness that death is likely. (Roach, Sankoff and Manning)\nWhether a person was reckless or wilfully blind does not involve a consideration of the perspective of the reasonable person. Where an offence requires proof of recklessness or wilful blindness, the question for the trier of fact is not whether the accused ought to have been aware of a risk, or ought to have made an inquiry, but rather, whether she was personally aware of a risk or deliberately ignorant of the need for an inquiry. (Sansregret, Briscoe)\nObjective forms of mens rea: #  Objective forms of mens rea are offences in which one or another part of the fault element of the offence is assessed in terms of the reasonable person.\nThe form or level of objective fault may vary depending on the offence. Some offences require only \u0026lsquo;objective knowledge,\u0026rsquo; or the reasonable person\u0026rsquo;s awareness of the risk of a prohibited consequence. Other offences employ the concept of negligence and are assessed in terms of the accused\u0026rsquo;s departure from the standard of care of the reasonable person.\nCriminal offences that involve the concept of negligence take two forms. \u0026ldquo;Criminal negligence\u0026rdquo; refers exclusively to the offences set out in sections 219, 220, and 221. These hold a person criminally responsible for either their awareness of or failure to be aware of the risk arising from conduct amounting to a marked and substantial departure from the standard of care the reasonable person and their failure to avoid it where the reasonable person in their circumstances would have been able to.\nBy contrast, all other criminal offences that involve negligence (i.e., the departure from a standard of care) are referred to as \u0026ldquo;penal negligence\u0026rdquo; offences. A person is held responsible under these offences for the same awareness or failure to be aware of a risk arising from their conduct as in \u0026ldquo;criminal negligence\u0026rdquo; offences, but here the standard is simply conduct amounting to a marked departure from that of the reasonable person.\nFor all criminal offences involving objective forms of fault, the onus remains on the Crown to prove mens rea.\nBy contrast, the Supreme Court in Wholesale Travel held that the minimum level of fault required in order for a regulatory offence carrying a prison sentence to be consistent with section 7 of the Charter is negligence simplicitor. (Thus, a provincial offence leading to jail can rest on strict liability.)\nIn a strict liability offence, negligence may be inferred from the actus reus in the absence of proof that the accused acted with reasonable care (due diligence). The Crown need not prove a fault element \u0026ndash; it suffices for the negligence to be inferred from the actus reus with the persuasive burden shifting to the accused to prove a lack of negligence. (Wholesale Travel)\nIn criminal offences involving an objective form of fault, courts apply a \u0026ldquo;modified objective test,\u0026rdquo; which asks whether the risk raised by the conduct at issue would have been foreseeable to the reasonable person in the same circumstances of the accused \u0026ndash; but without the reasonable person sharing the personal characteristics of the accused such as age, education, and experience. (Creighton)\ni. Objective foresight or knowledge: #  Forms of objective fault are found in a variety of offences. For example, some might require that a person \u0026ldquo;knew or ought to have known\u0026rdquo; something. Some offences of objective fault entail a dual structure where part of the actus reus might require subjective (or objective) fault but the prohibited consequence requires only objective foresight of non-trivial harm. Examples of this include manslaughter, unlawful act causing bodily harm, and assault causing bodily harm.\nIn the case of manslaughter (by unlawful act) or unlawful act causing bodily harm (s. 269), the Crown must prove the mens rea for the unlawful act (intent for assault), along with objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm beyond the trivial or the transitory. (Creighton, DeSousa)\nii. Penal and criminal negligence: #  In Creighton, the Court set out a general framework for assessing the actus reus and mens rea for penal negligence offences:\n Actus reus: an act or omission constituting a marked departure from the conduct of the reasonably prudent person in the circumstances.\nMens rea: (a) awareness of the risk arising from conduct amounting to a marked departure from that of the reasonable person in the circumstances; or\n(b) the failure to be aware of this risk where it was objectively foreseeable (which may be inferred from the actus reus absent evidence of incapacity or a reasonable mistake of fact).\n To be clear, where the actus reus has been proved (i.e., conduct amounting to a marked departure), the accused bears an evidentiary but not a persuasive burden with respect to the defences of incapacity and mistake of fact. The accused can thus raise a doubt about whether the reasonable person in her circumstances would have been aware of the risk by virtue of adducing some evidence of:\n i. incapacity (i.e., the accused suffered some physical or mental incapacity that would have prevented the reasonable person, suffering the same condition, from appreciating the risk posed by the conduct at issue, or abiding by a reasonable standard of care); or\nii. an honest and reasonable belief in a mistaken fact. (Creighton, Beatty)\n For either defence, once the evidentiary burden is met (some evidence), the persuasive burden remains on the Crown to prove BARD that incapacity or mistake of fact do not apply (i.e., there is no reasonable possibility that they do apply). (See note on mistake of fact below.)\nThe Supreme Court in R v JF confirmed that a similar framework applies to criminal negligence (s. 219):\n Actus reus: an act or omission \u0026ldquo;showing wanton and reckless disregard\u0026rdquo; for the lives or safety of others, which is assessed on the basis of whether the conduct in question constituted a marked and substantial departure from the standard of care of the reasonable person in the circumstances [+ causing either bodily harm or death, depending on whether person is charged under section 220 or 221].\nMens rea: (a) awareness of the risk to lives or safety of others arising from conduct amounting to a marked and substantial departure from that of the reasonable person in the circumstances; or\n(b) the failure to be aware of this risk where it was objectively foreseeable (which may be inferred from the actus reus absent evidence of incapacity or a reasonable mistake of fact).\n The defences to criminal negligence would operate in the same fashion as those for penal negligence offences, as noted above.\nThe Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Beatty entails a slight exception to this framework for negligence-based criminal offences in that it holds that the actus reus for dangerous driving in s. 249 is driving that is \u0026ldquo;objectively dangerous, having regard to all the circumstances.\u0026rdquo; The SCC in Roy held that to establish the mens rea under 249, the Crown must prove that the reasonable person in the circumstances would have foreseen the risk arising from the driving and taken steps to avoid it, or that the accused\u0026rsquo;s failure to foresee the risk and take steps to avoid it constituted a marked departure from the standard of care of the reasonable driver (absent evidence of incapacity or a reasonable mistake of fact).\nIn a series of cases dealing with penal negligence, the Supreme Court has held that given the criminal nature of these offences, section 7 of the Charter requires at least proof on the part of the Crown of negligence to the standard of a marked departure. Put otherwise, the minimal constitutional standard of negligence for a criminal offence is proof of conduct amounting to a marked departure from the standard of care of the reasonable person\u0026mdash;and either the accused\u0026rsquo;s awareness of this or their failure to be aware in circumstances in which the reasonable person would have been aware. (Creighton, Hundal, Beatty)\nStrict Liability: #  Where a regulatory offence is silent as to mens rea, there is a presumption that it is a strict liability offence. (Sault Ste-Marie)\nIn a strict liability offence, the Crown must prove only the actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused may raise a doubt about the actus reus by adducing evidence that the act was involuntary (or by raising a doubt about whether it was voluntary). (S.S. Marie)\nIn a strict liability offence, once the Crown has proved the actus reus, the accused is entitled to an acquittal if he can establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he:\ni. took all reasonable care to avoid the event (due diligence); or\nii. reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts. (S.S. Marie, Wholesale Travel)\nIn assessing reasonable care or reasonable mistake of fact here, \u0026ldquo;the Court considers circumstances that the reasonable person would have seen, not the circumstances that the accused actually perceived.\u0026rdquo; (K. Roach, Criminal Law, 5^th^ edition.)\nPlacing the accused in this reverse onus violates 11(d) of the Charter but is justified under s. 1 on the basis of the importance of strict liability offences as a means of advancing public policy objectives and the difficulty of requiring the Crown to prove negligence in cases of this nature. (Wholesale Travel)\nAbsolute Liability: #  In an absolute liability offence, the Crown need only prove the actus reus (beyond a reasonable doubt). The accused may raise a doubt whether the actus reus has been proved and/or was carried out voluntarily.\nAn offence is presumed not to involve absolute liability unless Parliament or the legislature makes this intention clear through explicit language, or if the subject matter or context implies this. (Levis, Sault Ste. Marie)\nAn absolute liability offence that gives rise to the possibility of imprisonment or other deprivations of liberty (probation) violates section 7 of the Charter and is not justified under section 1. (B.C. Motor Vehicle Reference)\nAn absolute liability offence may be defended by seeking to raise a doubt about whether the actus reus was committed voluntarily due to automatism, mental disorder, extreme intoxication, or necessity. The defence of mistake of fact (even if reasonable) is not available. (Hickey, OCA 1976; K. Roach, Criminal Law, 5^th^ edition.)\nConstitutional Considerations: #  The Supreme Court has held that certain offences carry a \u0026ldquo;special stigma\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; possibly involving the penalty attached to them, but not necessarily \u0026ndash; and that the principles of fundamental justice require proof of a level of fault commensurate with this stigma. A conviction for theft would require \u0026ldquo;proof of some dishonesty,\u0026rdquo; for murder, proof of \u0026ldquo;subjective foresight\u0026rdquo; of death. (Vaillancourt, Martineau)\nA conviction for murder cannot be based on proof of an objective form of fault, i.e., what the accused \u0026ldquo;ought to have known\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ought to have foreseen.\u0026rdquo; (Martineau)\nIn the case of \u0026lsquo;war crimes\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;crimes against humanity,\u0026rsquo; fundamental justice requires more than the mens rea for the various crimes committed as part of these offences (murder, kidnapping, etc.). It also requires additional subjective mens rea of the fact that the actions in question are carried out in circumstances which bring the offence within the definition of war crimes or crimes against humanity. (Finta)\nNote on the defence of \u0026lsquo;mistake of fact\u0026rsquo; #  Mistake of fact is a defence in the sense that it may form the basis of a reasonable doubt about mens rea rather than serving as a justification or excuse where elements of the offence have been established.\nIn the case of full or subjective mens rea offences, an honest but mistaken belief in a fact may raise a doubt about mens rea even if the belief is not reasonable.\nIn the case of subjective mens rea offences, \u0026ldquo;the existence or non-existence of reasonable grounds\u0026rdquo; for a mistaken belief \u0026ldquo;is merely relevant evidence to be weighed\u0026rdquo; by the trier of fact in assessing whether the belief was honestly held. (Rees)\nIn the context of sexual assault (a subjective mens rea offence), the operation of this rule has been qualified by section 273.2(b) which states that an accused may not rely on a mistaken belief in consent unless he or she can establish that they took \u0026ldquo;reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the case of negligence-based and objective mens rea offences (objective foresight), mistake of fact is available as a defence but subject to the requirement that the mistaken fact be both honestly held and reasonable (i.e., in the eyes of the reasonable person).\nEvidentiary and Persuasive Burdens in Mistake of Fact: #  For full subjective and objective fault criminal offences: #  The accused bears an evidentiary but not a persuasive burden to rely on this defence. The test for an evidentiary burden in the case of defences generally is that the accused must simply raise some evidence for each element of the defence on which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could acquit if it believed the evidence to be true (or in this case, if it believed the mistake was honestly held [and also, for objective fault offences, reasonable]).\nOnce the evidentiary burden is met (i.e., \u0026lsquo;some evidence for each element\u0026rsquo;), the Crown must prove BARD that the mistake was either not honestly held or, in the context of an objective fault offence, not honestly held or not reasonable or both. (i.e., that there is no reasonable possibility that\u0026hellip;)\nFor strict liability: #  The Crown bears a burden to prove only the actus reus BARD, and then both the evidentiary and persuasive burdens shift to the accused to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that she took reasonable steps to avoid the conduct at issue or acted on the basis of a belief, honestly and reasonably held, amounting to a mistake of fact.\n  Note that in some cases the Code or statute may provide otherwise: e.g., section 429(1) of the Code states that in Part XI of the Code, a person may do something \u0026lsquo;wilfully\u0026rsquo; where she acts with knowledge that a prohibited consequence is only probable. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "}),a.add({id:7,href:'/sum/docs/substantive_topics/2.-participation_offences/',title:"2. Participation Offences",section:"Substantive Topics",content:"Summary of Participation offences #  Overview #  This summary includes:\n1. Counselling\n2. Conspiracy\n3. Attempts\n4. Parties\n5. Accessory After the Fact\n6. Final Points\n 1. Counselling: #  Section 22(1) makes a person a party to an offence where they counsel a person to commit an act that is an offence, and that person commits it.\nSection 22(2) makes a person a party to an offence where they counsel a person to commit an act that is an offence and the person commits another offence that was reasonably foreseeable from the act counselled. (This allows for a criminal conviction on an objective standard and is thus likely invalid under section 7 in many cases.)\nCounselling can be defined as the act of telling, persuading, inciting, procuring, or soliciting another to commit an act that is an offence. (Hamilton)\nSection 464 sets out the distinct offence of \u0026ldquo;counselling an offence that is not committed.\u0026rdquo; It renders the jeopardy of a person who counsels to be the same as that of an attempt to commit the offence counselled (i.e., half the jeopardy of the indictable offence; the same if it\u0026rsquo;s summary).\nThe elements of counselling a crime that is committed: s 22(1) #   Actus reus: active inducement or encouragement to do an act that is an offence + the offence being committed or an offence that is reasonably foreseeable from the act counseled.\nMens rea: the accused intentionally counsels (encourages / induces) and intends that the act be committed or knows that it likely will be. (Janeteas, for both elements)\n The elements of counselling a crime that is not committed: s 464 #   Actus reus: active inducement or encouragement of the commission of a criminal offence.\nMens rea: intent that the offence counselled be committed, or knowingly counseling when aware of an unjustified risk that the offence is likely to be committed. (Hamilton for both elements)\n(The Court in Hamilton distinguishes the second element of the mens rea from mere recklessness on the basis that it requires an awareness not of the possibility but of the likelihood that the offence will be committed.)\n 2. Conspiracy: #  Codified in s 465 but defined at common law, \u0026lsquo;conspiracy\u0026rsquo; consists in an agreement (tacit or express) between two or more persons to commit an offence. The offence lies in the fact of the agreement and a common intention (between two or more persons) to put the common design into effect. No further acts or elements are necessary.\nThe actus reus of conspiracy [in a prosecution against a single conspirator] is the fact of the agreement between the accused and one or more other persons to commit an offence and the intention on the part of at least two or more of the parties (including the accused) to carry out the planned offence.\n (\u0026quot;\u0026hellip;[E]ach of the conspirators must have a genuine intention to participate in the agreement.\u0026quot; Dynar\nThe offence is thus unusual in the sense that a co-conspirator\u0026rsquo;s intention or mental state is part of the AR of the offence against the accused.)\n The mens rea is the accused\u0026rsquo;s intention to enter into the agreement and his or her intention to put the common design into effect.\nTo convict either or both parties to a conspiracy, the Crown must prove that there was an agreement between two or more, and that both intended to carry it out; mere words by one party (e.g., an undercover officer) would not suffice to establish an agreement. (O' Brien)\nThere must be a \u0026lsquo;common design\u0026rsquo; or some general agreement about the nature of the offence to be committed (\u0026ldquo;a common purpose of a single enterprise\u0026rdquo;), though there may be changes to the plan over time. (Cotroni).\nA conspiracy is not established simply on the basis of proof of knowledge of the plan, or of participation in it. (i.e., the Crown is required to prove an agreement: an intent, among two or more, to enter into it the scheme and to carry it out.)\n3. Attempts: #  Section 24(1) sets out the offence of attempting to commit an offence and renders a person culpable for the offence regardless of whether it was (factually) impossible to it.\nElements of attempt #   Actus reus: going beyond mere preparation to commit the offence. (Deutch)\nMens rea: an intention to commit the predicate offence. (Ancio)\n Points from the case law #  On the actus reus:\n An act goes \u0026ldquo;beyond mere preparation\u0026rdquo; in law when a person takes the first step toward committing the offence after preparation is complete. (Cline)\nThe question of whether preparation is complete is qualitative, with no clear line between mere preparation and attempt; where it is unclear whether preparation was complete, a court should assess the relative proximity of the steps taken to the complete offence, in terms of time, location, and acts to be completed. (Deutsch)\nWhere actions (possibly amounting to attempt) are, on their face, equivocal, the mens rea for committing the offence (or attempting to) cannot be inferred. (Sorrell and Bondet)\nThe general attempt provision, section 24(1), precludes as a defence the claim that it was factually impossible to commit the complete offence (reaching into a pocket to steal a wallet that wasn\u0026rsquo;t there). This left uncertain whether section 24(1) still allows for the defence of legal impossibility (if I tried to steal an umbrella that turned out to be mine, it would not have been a crime in law). The Supreme Court in Dynar held the distinction between these two forms of impossibility to be untenable: they are both essentially forms of factual impossibility.\nIn place of the distinction between factual and legal impossibility, the SCC in Dynar held that the only relevant distinction to draw here is one between factually impossible offences and \u0026lsquo;imaginary crimes.\u0026rsquo; Only the latter are a defence to attempt, distinguished where the fault element in the offence refers to a mens rea not known to Canadian law.\nFor example*,* where you reach into a pocket to steal a wallet that isn\u0026rsquo;t there or try to steal an umbrella that happens to be yours, you have the *mens rea* for theft. If you smuggle sugar into Canada **knowing** it to be sugar but believing it to be a crime to \u0026lsquo;import sugar\u0026rsquo;, you do not have the *mens rea* of an offence under Canadian law.\n Points from the case law on the mens rea of attempt:\n Where an offence might require a lesser form of mens rea to obtain a conviction for the complete offence (recklessness, knowledge, etc.), a conviction for attempting to commit that offence will require nothing less than the intention to carry out the complete offence (all elements). (Ancio, Williams)\n(e.g., murder allows for a conviction where there is either an intent to kill or an intent to do bodily harm that the accused knows is likely to cause death; but for attempted murder, subjective foresight of death will not suffice. A conviction requires an intent to cause death. Similarly, while aggravated assault requires only subjective fault for assault + objective foreseeability of the aggravated consequences (maiming, endangerment, etc.), the offence of \u0026lsquo;attempted aggravated assault\u0026rsquo; requires an intent to cause maiming, endangerment, etc.)\n 4. Parties #  Section 21 renders a person a party to an offence where he or she aids or abets a principal offender (21(1)) or forms an intention in common intention to carry out an unlawful purpose (21(2)).\nAiding means assisting or helping; abetting means encouraging, instigating, or promoting. (Briscoe, Greyeyes)\nElements of Aiding in s. 21(1)(b): #  The Court set these out in Briscoe:\n The actus reus of aiding is doing or omitting to do something to assist in the commission of an offence.\nThe mens rea of aiding has two parts:\na. an intent to assist the principal in committing the offence; and\nb. knowledge of the type of offence the principal intends to commit \u0026gt; (but not the precise manner).\n Willful blindness may substitute here for knowledge. (Briscoe)\nElements of Abetting in s. 21(1)(c) #  The actus reus of abetting is encouraging another to commit the offence.\nThe mens rea is intentionally or knowingly encouraging a person to commit the offence.\nIn the case of murder, a party either aiding or abetting would require the additional element of \u0026ldquo;knowledge that death is likely.\u0026rdquo; (Martineau, Kirkness)\nIn the case of being a party to attempt murder, the mens rea for aiding or abetting would be intending to do something to aid or abet and knowledge that the principal will likely do something with the intent to kill. (Drawing from Logan on knowledge for attempt murder under 21(2).)\nPoints from the case law on s. 21(1) #  A person neither aids nor abets a crime for being merely present at the scene of a crime in circumstances consistent with innocence. Nor do they become a party for failing to prevent a crime, so long as they are not under a duty to act. (Dunlop and Sylvester, Jackson)\nAiding or abetting require more than mere presence. This can include encouragement, facilitation (keeping watch, holding victim down), or preventing interference with the criminal act. (Dunlop and Sylvester)\nPresence may amount to aiding or abetting where a person had prior knowledge of the principal\u0026rsquo;s intent to commit the offence or where they attended for the purpose of encouraging. (Dunlop and Sylvester)\nA person\u0026rsquo;s presence may also support a finding of aiding or abetting based on the totality of factors including the accused\u0026rsquo;s apprehension at the scene, the Court\u0026rsquo;s rejection of his explanation for being there, the nature of the offence, the context in which it was committed, or other circumstantial evidence of guilt. (Jackson)\nA court may convict a person as a party where the elements of the offence under s. 21(1)(a),(b), or (c) or 21(2) can be established, even though the identity of the principal is unknown, or the precise role played by the party and the principal in the commission of the offence is unclear. (Thatcher)\nIn such a case, the jury need not be unanimous as to whether the accused was a party or a principal, so long as jury members are in agreement that the evidence proves BARD that he was one or the other. (Thatcher)\nA person who aids or abets only a purchaser cannot be convicted as a party to trafficking under section 5 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. But a person who aids both a purchaser and a seller, can be found guilty of being a party to trafficking \u0026ndash; even though she worked primarily with or on behalf of the purchaser. (Greyeyes)\nCommon intent, s. 21(2): #  Under section 21(2), where a person forms an intention in common with another person to carry out an unlawful purpose (an act that is a criminal offence) and to assist the other person in carrying it out, he or she is liable (as a party) for offences committed by the other person that he or she knew or ought to have known would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose.\n Actus reus: forming of an intent in common to carry out an unlawful purpose (a criminal act) and to assist each other in carrying it out, along with the offence being carried out or any reasonably foreseeable offence (or lesser included offence).\nMens rea: an intention to carry out the unlawful purpose and to assist the other person(s) therein, along with knowledge or objective foreseeability that the (actual) offence would be carried out. (Hibbert)\n The objective element of the mens rea in 21(2) does not apply to a party to a murder or attempt murder. (A conviction based on objective mens rea in the case of murder or attempt murder violates section 7: Martineau, Logan.)\nThe mens rea for murder under 21(2) is the same as is set out above, except the knowledge element would be: knowledge that death would likely result from the unlawful purpose that two or more parties intend to carry out. (Martineau, Logan)\nIn the case of being a party to attempt murder under 21(2), the mens rea is: forming an intent to carry out an unlawful purpose + an intent to assist another therein + knowledge that the principal will likely do something with the intent to kill. (Logan)\n A person charged as a party to murder or attempt murder under section 21(2) may be liable for a lesser included offence such as manslaughter or assault (i.e., if they intended to carry out an act that gives rise to the reasonable possibility of causing bodily harm beyond the trivial or transitory: Creighton, Logan).\n 5. Accessory after the fact #  Section 23 makes it an offence to receive, comfort, or assist a person that one knows has been a party to an offence for purpose of enabling them to escape.\n Actus reus: receiving, comforting, or assisting a fugitive.\nMens rea has two components:\ni. subjective knowledge that the fugitive has been a party to an offence; and\nii. assisting the fugitive for the purpose of helping him escape.\n Willful blindness may serve as a substitute for the knowledge element here. (Duong)\nThe actus reus requires a positive act (receiving, comforting, etc.) rather than just a failure to inform authorities about a fugitive\u0026rsquo;s whereabouts. (Dumont)\nAdvising a fugitive that police had their names and licence numbers is sufficient for the actus reus. (Young, QCA)\nIt will not suffice to prove that acts of assistance had the effect of helping a fugitive to escape; the Crown must also prove that they were done for this purpose. (McVay)\nTo establish that the fugitive \u0026lsquo;has been a party to an offence\u0026rsquo;, the Crown must prove that the fugitive has committed the actus reus of that offence. (R v. S(FJ))1\nThe accused can be convicted of being an accessory after the fact even if the principal was acquitted. (s. 23.1 and Shalaan, SCC 1998)\n6. Final points: #  A person accused as a party to an offence or to attempting an offence may invoke the doctrine of abandonment to raise a doubt as to whether they had the requisite mens rea or whether they committed the actus reus (depending on the facts). In the case of attempt, the accused must abandon before they have moved ‘beyond mere preparation’.2\nTest for abandoment involving a party #  In R v Gauthier, the SCC set out a four-part test for when a party has abandoned an offence: the accused must establish an an air of reality that they:\n(i) had an intent to withdraw;\n(ii) gave timely notice to the principal(s);\n(iii) gave unequivocal notice; and\n(iv) took reasonable steps to neutralize or cancel out the effective of their participation in a manner proportionate to their involvement in the offence.\n Once the evidentiary burden is met for each element of this test, the Crown has the (persuasive) burden to establish BARD that one or more element does not apply.\nWhere the principal cannot be convicted: s 23.1 #  Section 23.1 of the Code states that a person may be convicted under sections 21 to 23 (i.e., as a party for aiding, abetting, forming an intention in common; for counselling; or as an accessory after the fact) despite the fact that the person whom they aid, abet, form an intent in common with, counsel, or assist as an accessory cannot be convicted of the offence.\n  Section 657.2(2) of the Code states that evidence from a prosecution of another person for the offence is admissible against the accused and \u0026ldquo;in the absence of evidence to the contrary is proof that the offence was committed.\u0026rdquo; \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n A principal charged with attempt may also seek to rely on abandonment, but only if they abandon prior to preparation being complete. If so, the defence is indistinguishable from raising a doubt about the actus reus (i.e., whether the accused had taken a step beyond mere preparation).

Homicide",section:"Substantive Topics",content:"Summary of Homicide #  General points: #  Section 222 of the Criminal Code defines homicide as directly or indirectly causing the death of a human being. The Code sets out four forms of homicide: non-culpable, murder, manslaughter or infanticide.\nSection 234 states \u0026ldquo;culpable homicide that is not murder or infanticide is manslaughter.\u0026rdquo;\nInfanticide functions as both an offence (mother killing baby when still suffering post-partum effects) and a partial defence to murder (lowering murder to manslaughter).\nManslaughter may be punished up to life and has no mandatory minimum sentence, except with use of a firearm, which carries a 4-year minimum.\nMurder carries a mandatory life sentence, with a minimum 10-year parole ineligibility period for second degree, and 25 years of ineligibility for first degree. (Different rules apply to a \u0026lsquo;young person\u0026rsquo; who commits murder, even when sentenced as an adult.)\nManslaughter #  The most common forms of manslaughter are set out in section 222(5):\n -section 222(5)(a) causing death by an unlawful act;1 or\n-section 222(5)(b) by criminal negligence.\n Unlawful act manslaughter: #  The actus reus of unlawful act manslaughter is an unlawful act that causes death. The unlawful act may consist of any federal or provincial offence other than an absolute liability offence, and one that entails a risk of bodily harm.2 (DeSousa)\nThe mens rea for unlawful act manslaughter is (a) the fault element for the unlawful act and (b) objective foreseeability of a risk of bodily harm beyond the trivial or transitory. (Creighton)\nThe reasonable person in this test (as in all objective fault offences) is one who is in the same circumstances as the accused and shares only the characteristics of the accused that would render her unable to appreciate the risk (i.e., the same incapacities as the accused). (Creighton)\nManslaughter caused by criminal negligence (s 220) #   Actus reus: An act or omission \u0026ldquo;showing wanton and reckless disregard\u0026rdquo; for the lives or safety of others, which is assessed on the basis of whether the conduct in question constituted a marked and substantial departure from the standard of care of the reasonable person in the circumstances + causing death.\nMens rea: (a) awareness of the risk presented by this conduct or (b) the failure to be aware of the risk where it was objectively foreseeable, and absent evidence of incapacity or a reasonable mistake of fact. (R. v. J(F))\n Murder #  Section 229 sets out four ways to commit murder: i. 229(a)(i) causing death where the accused means to cause death;\nii. 229(a)(ii) causing death where the accused means to cause bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause death;\niii. 229(b) where the accused means to cause death or bodily harm (that he knows is likely to cause death) in relation to one person but by accident or mistake kills another; or\niv. 229(c) where a person pursuing an unlawful object does anything that he knows is likely to cause death and causes death despite the fact that he desired to effect the unlawful object without causing death or bodily harm.\n Knowledge that harm is \u0026ldquo;likely to cause death\u0026rdquo; in section 229(a)(ii) means knowledge that death is \u0026ldquo;probable\u0026rdquo; and not simply a possibility, a risk, or a chance. (Roks)\nCausation for murder: #  In addition to special rules for causation in sections 224 to 226 of the Code, which apply to all forms of culpable homicide, the general common law test for causation applies to murder: \u0026ldquo;a significant contributing cause.\u0026rdquo; (Nette)\nThis test also applies to section 231(2), which states generally that \u0026ldquo;Murder is first degree murder when it is planned and deliberate\u0026rdquo;, and to provisions which raise to first degree the murdering of a police officer (231(4)) and murder in the case of a contract killing (231(3)).\nA distinct causation test applies to provisions that raise second degree murder to first degree which contain the phrase \u0026ldquo;caused by that person\u0026rdquo; found in sections 231(5), 231(6), 231(6.01), (6.1), and (6.2): i.e., where death is intentionally caused during a sexual assault, kidnapping, hostage taking, criminal harassment, terrorism, etc.\nFor these provisions, the accused\u0026rsquo;s actions must be a \u0026ldquo;substantial and integral cause\u0026rdquo; (Harbottle).\n First degree murder: #  First degree murder is not a distinct offence but a classification of a form of murder for sentencing purposes. (The Crown must first establish the elements for murder.)\nMurder is first degree murder when it is planned and deliberate. (Section 231(2))\n -planned means a \u0026ldquo;calculated scheme or design\u0026rdquo; though either can be simple. A murder may be \u0026ldquo;planned\u0026rdquo; even if it is immediately carried out. (Widdifield)\n-deliberate means \u0026ldquo;slow in deciding,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;considered,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;not impulsive.\u0026rdquo; (More)\n-murder can be \u0026ldquo;planned and deliberate\u0026rdquo; even where it entails a plan to inflict bodily harm with knowledge that it is likely to cause death. (Nygaard)\n A murder will be first degree under section 231(5) if death is caused \u0026ldquo;while committing\u0026rdquo; a series of offences including sexual assault and unlawful confinement. The victim of the murder need not be the victim of the listed offence. (Russell)\nWhere an accused has the mens rea for murder, and the murder is planned and deliberate but the accused by accident kills another person, that act is murder in the first degree. (Droste)\nWhere murder is raised from second to first degree under section 231(4) (murder of a peace officer in execution of duty, among other circumstances), the Crown must prove subjective knowledge of the facts in the provision (i.e., the victim was an officer in the execution of his duty, etc.). (Collins)\nAll murder that is not first degree murder is second degree. (Section 231(7))\n  An unlawful act causing death might also be murder or infanticide, if the elements for those offences are made out (the elements are set out in sections 229 and 233, respectively). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s holdings in Creighton and DeSousa suggest that if the unlawful act here is a strict liability offence, the court should read in the standard of penal negligence: i.e., the Crown must prove BARD that the unlawful act constituted a marked departure from the conduct of the reasonable person. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "}),a.add({id:9,href:'/sum/docs/substantive_topics/4.-provocation/',title:"4. Provocation",section:"Substantive Topics",content:"Summary of Provocation #  General points: #  Section 232(1) states: \u0026ldquo;Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.\u0026rdquo;\nSection 232(2) defines provocation as follows: \u0026ldquo;Conduct of the victim that would constitute an indictable offence under this Act that is punishable by five or more years of imprisonment and that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section, if the accused acted on it on the sudden and before there was time for their passion to cool.\u0026rdquo;\nProvocation does not apply to an act the accused has provoked or an act that arises from the victim\u0026rsquo;s exercise of a legal right\u0026mdash;i.e., an officer carrying out a lawful arrest. (232(3))\nPrior to 2015, the portion of section 232(2) underlined above was not part of the provision. Instead of the portion underlined above, the provision defined provocation as a \u0026lsquo;wrongful act or insult\u0026rsquo; by the victim that would cause an ordinary person to lose the power of self-control, with the accused acting on the sudden and before there was time for their passions to cool.\nIn 2019, the BC Supreme Court, in R v Simard held that the words added to 232(2) in the 2015 amendments violate section 7 of the Charter (and the SCC dismissed a direct application for leave to appeal this decision). What follows is a summary of the law remaining valid in BC.\nElements of the defence of provocation set out in R v. Hill:\n(1) Would an ordinary person be deprived of self-control by the victim\u0026rsquo;s act? (objective)\n(2) Did A in fact act lose control as a result of these provocative acts? (subjective)\n(3) Was A\u0026rsquo;s response sudden and before there was time for passions to cool? (subjective)\n The question at stage 1 is not whether the ordinary person would have done what the accused did but whether the act would have provoked them to lose the power of self-control. (Hill)\nBefore the defence may be put to the jury, the accused must raise an air of reality for each element of the defence (i.e., there must be some evidence on which a jury, acting reasonably, might conclude that the accused\u0026rsquo;s response was \u0026ldquo;sudden and before her passions had cooled\u0026rdquo; [or whatever the element requires]).\nOnce an air of reality has been established, the burden shifts to the Crown to prove BARD that one or more elements of the defence do not apply. (e.g., there was no reasonable possibility that the accused acted on the sudden\u0026hellip;)\nThe Supreme Court in Tran held: \u0026ldquo;For the defence to succeed, the jury must have a reasonable doubt about whether each of the elements of provocation was present.\u0026rdquo; Put otherwise, the jury must conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that each element applies.\nProvocation is not a defence to attempted murder; but evidence of provocation may be invoked here to raise a doubt about whether the accused had the specific intent to kill. (Campbell)\nSpecific points: #  In the first part of the Hill test, the \u0026lsquo;ordinary person\u0026rsquo; is:\n-not exceptionally excitable, pugnacious or drunk;\n -the same age, race, and sex as the accused, if these are relevant to a \u0026lsquo;particular feature of the provocation in question\u0026rsquo;; and\n -subjected to the same circumstances as the accused. (Hill)\nThe ordinary person also shares the background history between the accused and the victim, and this can be considered when assessing whether the act would suffice to cause the ordinary person to lose self-control. (Thibert)\nThe ordinary person does not share characteristics with the accused that conflict with Charter values: e.g., the accused\u0026rsquo;s homophobia or belief in honour killing. (Tran)\nIn the second part of Hill test, when assessing whether the accused lost self-control, the court can consider all aspects particular to the accused, including intoxication, mental state or psychological temperament, and the history of the relationship with the victim. (Hill, Thibert)\nThe provocative act must be sudden; it cannot amount to knowledge one already possessed. (Tran)\nActing out of anger alone will not suffice to constitute provocation; all of the elements of the defence must be made out.

Mental Disorder",section:"Substantive Topics",content:"Summary of Mental Disorder #  Overview #  Distinguish the following procedural facets:\n  Fitness to stand trial\n  Mental disorder defence (at trial)\n  Review Board dispositions\n  1. Fitness to stand trial: #  The accused, the Crown, or the court on its own motion may raise the issue of the accused\u0026rsquo;s fitness to stand trial at any time during a prosecution before the verdict is rendered. (By contrast, the Crown is restricted as to when it may raise the defence of mental disorder. See below.)\nThe accused is presumed to be fit to stand trial, unless the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the accused is not fit. The persuasive burden rests on the party raising the issue of fitness. (section 672.22)\nTest for fitness\nSection 2 of the Criminal Code states that a person is \u0026ldquo;unfit to stand trial\u0026rdquo; where, \u0026ldquo;on account of mental disorder, [she is unable] to conduct a defence at any stage of the proceedings before a verdict is rendered or to instruct counsel to do so, and, in particular, unable on account of mental disorder to:\na. understand the nature or object of the proceedings,\nb. understand the possible consequences of the proceedings, or\nc. communicate with counsel\u0026rdquo;.\n To be found fit under section 2, the accused need only possess a \u0026ldquo;limited cognitive capacity to understand the process and to communicate with counsel.\u0026rdquo; He need not be \u0026ldquo;capable of making rational decisions beneficial to him.\u0026rdquo; (Whittle)\nA person found unfit can be tried at a later time, if he is later found to be fit. If the Crown seeks to preserve the status of a prosecution while waiting for the accused to become fit, the Crown must establish a prima facie case for the offence every two years. (section 672.33)\nA person found unfit to stand trial is remanded to the Review Board for a disposition hearing under section 672.54 (the court can also carry out the disposition hearing but usually remits the matter to the Board). In that hearing, an accused who has been found unfit to stand trial may be released on conditions or be ordered to remain in hospital, but may not be discharged absolutely. (s. 672.54)\nIf the court finds that a person is not likely to ever become fit to stand trial and does not pose a significant threat to public safety, the court may grant a stay of prosecution. (Demers; s. 672.851).1\n2. Mental disorder defence: #  The mental disorder defence is set out in section 16 of the Code, and the phrase \u0026ldquo;mental disorder\u0026rdquo; is a defined term in section 2. The defence serves to exempt a person from criminal liability based on an incapacity for criminal intent or excuse what would otherwise be a criminal offence. (Chaulk)\nThe mental disorder defence\nSection 16 states that a person is not to be found criminally responsible for an act or omission committed \u0026ldquo;while suffering from a mental disorder that rendered the person incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong.\u0026rdquo;\n  (A key element of the test is the causal connection: the failure to appreciate the nature or quality of the act, or to know it was wrong, must be an effect of the mental disorder.)\n Section 2 defines \u0026ldquo;mental disorder\u0026rdquo; as a \u0026ldquo;disease of the mind,\u0026rdquo; thus incorporating the common law definitions of this phrase (see below).\nEither the accused or the Crown may invoke the defence of mental disorder. Before it may be put to the jury, the party seeking to rely on it must establish an air of reality for each element of the defence.\nOnce an air of reality has been established, the burden remains with the party seeking to rely on the defence to persuade the trier of fact that each element of the defence applies on a balance of probabilities.\n This violates the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d), because it allows for a conviction where there is a reasonable doubt about mens rea or the voluntariness of the actus reus. The violation has been held to be a reasonable limit on the right, under s. 1, because, among other reasons, the accused is in the best position to present evidence as to their mental state. (Chaulk)\n While the accused may raise the mental disorder defence at any point during the trial, the Crown may raise the defence in only two instances: (a) once it has established a prima facie case for the elements of the offence (mens rea and actus reus); or (b) when, in the course of the trial, the accused has raised the issue of his or her capacity for criminal intent (e.g., voluntariness, automatism, etc.) (Swain).\nIf the court (or jury) finds that the test in section 16 has been met on a balance of probabilities, the accused is found \u0026ldquo;not criminally responsible due to mental disorder\u0026rdquo; (NCRMD) and remanded to the Review Board for a disposition hearing under section 672.54 within 45 days.\nIf the judge or jury finds that the elements of the mental disorder defence have not been established on a balance of probabilities, the facts supporting the defence may still be considered in assessing whether the mens rea of the offence has been established beyond a reasonable doubt.\n For example, facts relating to the accused\u0026rsquo;s mental state at the time of the offence might fall short of the elements in section 16, but still raise a reasonable doubt about whether a murder was \u0026ldquo;planned and deliberate,\u0026rdquo; or whether the accused had the necessary intent for murder (\u0026ldquo;means to cause death\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;means to cause bodily that he knows is likely cause death\u0026rdquo;). (Swain)\n \u0026lsquo;Disease of the mind\u0026rsquo; #  Whether a person suffers from a \u0026ldquo;disease of the mind\u0026rdquo; is a legal and not a medical issue. Medical evidence assists in deciding the issue but is not determinative.

(The belief is to be assessed on an exclusively subjective basis.) (Mena, Ruzik)\nSection 17 also requires that the threat be immediate and that the person making the threat be present at the time of the offence. In Ruzik, the SCC found that these two requirements violate section 7 of the Charter; the violation cannot be justified under section 1; and as a result, these requirements were struck down, but not the rest of the section.\n (The requirements of immediacy and presence violate s 7 because they allow for a conviction in cases involving \u0026ldquo;morally involuntary\u0026rdquo; acts, which the Court in Ruzik held is contrary to \u0026lsquo;fundamental justice\u0026rsquo;.

(Ryan)\nSection 17 applies only to principal offenders, or \u0026ldquo;a person who commits an offence\u0026rdquo; (Paquette)\nWhere it is unclear whether a person acted as principal or as party, both the common law and statutory defence should be put to the jury, so long as there is an air of reality for each aspect of each defence (Mena)\nWhere a person charged as a party to an offence acts under some form of compulsion, this fact alone would not negate or raise a doubt about whether he or she had the mens rea for aiding or abetting, or acting with a \u0026ldquo;common intention,\u0026rdquo; in sections 21(1) or 21(2). (Those provisions require a basic intent to aid the principal, but not a desire that the principal\u0026rsquo;s crime be committed.) A prima facie case may thus be made out for being a party to an offence, but the accused may then rely on the common law defence of duress \u0026ndash; if she can establish an air of reality for each element of the defence.

Roach on Beard)\nA general intent offence is \u0026ldquo;one in which the only intent involved relates solely to the performance of the act in question with no further ulterior intent or purpose. The minimal intent to apply force in the offence of common assault affords an example.\u0026rdquo; (Bernard)\nA specific intent offence is one that involves the performance of the actus reus, coupled with an intent or purpose going beyond the mere performance of the act in question; for example: \u0026ldquo;[s]triking a blow \u0026hellip; with the intent to kill.\u0026rdquo; (Bernard)\nSelf-Induced Intoxication: #  An accused may rely on the defence of self-induced intoxication in the case of a crime of specific intent. (Bernard)\n (i.e., an accused can point to the mere fact that they were drunk to raise a reasonable doubt about whether, in the course of assaulting the victim, they had also formed the intent to kill, rob, etc.)\n Self-induced intoxication (to a degree less than extreme) is not a defence to a crime of general intent. (Leary, Bernard)\n Why is self-induced intox not a defence GI offences?\nWhere a person is intoxicated to a degree less than \u0026ldquo;extreme intoxication\u0026rdquo; (see below), the SCC has held that evidence of intoxication cannot form the basis for a doubt as to whether a person lacked the voluntariness or the minimal intent (i.e., intention or recklessness) for an offence of general intent. It may not do so because the Court held that mere intoxication cannot rebut the common law presumption that an accused acted voluntarily (i.e., that they intended the natural and probable consequences of their actions).\nPut otherwise, on the basis of the fact that the accused has committed the actus reus of a general intent offence, together with other supporting evidence, a court may infer the voluntariness and minimal intent for the offence \u0026ndash; and that inference may not be refuted by the mere fact that the accused was drunk. [Note that the accused may still seek to raise a doubt about voluntariness or intent through other evidence.] (Bernard)\nDoes this rule violate section 7?\nA majority of the SCC in Bernard held that the rule in Leary that self-induced intoxication (less than extreme) is not a defence to an offence of general intent is consistent with section 7 of the Charter, on the basis that an intoxicated person who commits the actus reus of a general intent offence demonstrates the voluntariness and minimal intent to render them morally culpable.\n By contrast, where an accused seeks to rely on the defence of self-induced intoxication in the case of a specific intent offence, facts about intoxication may serve to raise a doubt about whether the accused had formed the required specific intent. (Bernard)\nThe accused bears an evidentiary burden to establish an air or reality for the defence of intoxication. This requires some evidence on which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could acquit on the basis that the evidence raises a reasonable doubt about intent. Once an air of reality is established, the persuasive burden shifts to the Crown to prove, BARD, that the accused had the necessary intent. (George, Bernard)\nA person who is acquitted of a specific intent offence can be convicted of a lesser included offence if there is no reasonable doubt about whether they had the requisite intent for that lesser (general intent) offence. (George, Bernard)\nThe following have all been held to be offences of specific intent: murder, theft, robbery, aiding and abetting a crime and attempting a crime. The following have all been held to be crimes of general intent: manslaughter, assault, sexual assault, sexual assault causing bodily harm, and mischief. (Bernard; K. Roach, Criminal Law, 5^th^ edition.)\nIf the Crown establishes that an accused, due to intoxication, lacked the specific intent for murder but had the intent for an unlawful act resulting in death, the accused should be convicted of manslaughter. (Beard)\nSelf-induced intoxication is not a defence to any offence in which intoxication is an element. (Penno) But this rule appears to be qualified by the holding in Daviault (see below) that extreme intoxication can negate both voluntariness (actus reus) and the minimal intent in crimes of general intent.\nExtreme Intoxication: #  At common law, extreme intoxication is a defence to both general and specific intent offences (Daviault). (This proposition is now qualified by the application of s. 33.1, discussed below.)\nFor extreme intoxication, the accused bears the burden of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that she was so intoxicated at the time of the offence as to be in a state akin to automatism or a disease of the mind, and, as a result, was incapable of forming the requisite intent for the offence or acted involuntarily. (Daviault)\nPlacing the persuasive burden on the accused in extreme intoxication violates section 11(d) but is saved by section 1, on the basis that the accused is in the best position to prove the amount of alcohol consumed and its effect on him or her. (Daviault)\nSubject to s. 33.1, where extreme intoxication establishes that the accused was in a state akin to automatism or a mental disorder and acted involuntarily, she would have a defence to crimes of objective fault and absolute liability (which require that the actus reus be committed voluntarily). (The exceptions here are any such offences that contain as an element assault or the threat of bodily integrity, pursuant to s. 33.1.)\nSections 7 and 11(d) are violated where an accused is convicted of a general intent offence if, at the time of the offence, he or she was in a state of extreme intoxication (akin to automatism or a mental disorder) and lacked consciousness or control of their actions. (It remains to be seen whether such a violation \u0026ndash; as contemplated by section 33.1 \u0026ndash; could be saved by section 1 of the Charter.)\nSection 33.1: #  Section 33.1 of the Criminal Code qualifies the rule in Daviault by excluding the defence of self-induced extreme intoxication as a basis for arguing that one lacked either the general intent or voluntariness for offences in which assault is an element or for offences involving the interference or threat of interference with another person\u0026rsquo;s bodily integrity.\nSection 33.1(2) addresses the necessary mens rea and voluntariness issue in such instances by stating that \u0026ldquo;a person departs markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society and is thereby criminally at fault\u0026rdquo; where, by self-induced (extreme) intoxication, they become unaware of their \u0026ldquo;behavior\u0026rdquo; or incapable of \u0026ldquo;controlling\u0026rdquo; it and they \u0026ldquo;interfere with the bodily integrity of another person.\u0026rdquo;\n (Thus where a person becomes severely intoxicated, loses control or awareness of their actions, and threatens someone\u0026rsquo;s bodily integrity, they depart markedly from a standard of care. The fault appears to rest not only on becoming very drunk but on getting very drunk and interfering.)\n Section 33.1 would arguably violate sections 7 and 11(d) on the basis that it entails a substitution of the fault of becoming intoxicated (and departing from a standard) for the mens rea of the general intent offence at issue or the voluntariness necessary for the actus reus of that offence. It is expected to be challenged eventually at the SCC, with the main issue being whether the violation is a reasonable limit under section 1.\nInvoluntary Intoxication: #  An accused may rely on the defence of \u0026lsquo;involuntary intoxication\u0026rsquo; where she commits an offence after consuming a substance that (i) she did not know would result in her intoxication, and (ii) she could not reasonably have known. (King)\nThe defence may apply to negate either voluntariness of the actus reus or the mens rea or both, depending on the offence and the facts of the case.\nSection 33.1 does not preclude the operation of the involuntary intoxication defence to crimes of general or specific intent, including those involving assault or interferences with bodily integrity, since that section is limited to cases of self-induced intoxication.\nThe Nova Scotia Court of Appeal has held that intoxication will be held to be \u0026ldquo;self-induced\u0026rdquo; where the accused knew or ought to have known that a substance they consumed would result in their intoxication.

In many cases, fact B is an element of an offence that is difficult for the Crown to prove but flows logically from proof of fact A.\nMost presumptions are rebuttable, some are irrebuttable.\nAmong the class of rebuttable presumptions, we distinguish between evidentiary legal presumptions.\nEvidentiary presumptions: #  Evidentiary presumptions apply in provisions that use the phrase \u0026ldquo;in the absence of evidence to the contrary\u0026rdquo; (or something similar).1\nThey require the accused to adduce (or point to) some evidence to the contrary, but not to prove anything.\nAn evidentiary presumption gives rise to an evidentiary burden (\u0026lsquo;some evidence\u0026rsquo;).\nTest for meeting an evidentiary burden\nThe test for what constitutes an \u0026ldquo;air of reality\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;some evidence,\u0026rdquo; is: \u0026ldquo;any or some evidence on which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could convict\u0026rdquo; (Cinous, Fontaine). Whether this test is met is for the judge to decide, not the jury. (i.e., is there a possibility the contrary fact is true? The Crown must prove \u0026ndash; must persuade the trier of fact \u0026ndash; that there is no reasonable possibility that it is true.)\n Legal presumptions #  Legal presumptions apply in provisions that use the phrase “unless he establishes…” (or something similar).2\nIf the Crown proves fact A, a legal presumption permits the court to presume fact B unless the accused proves otherwise.\nLegal presumptions give rise to a persuasive burden on the accused (a \u0026lsquo;reverse onus\u0026rsquo;). In criminal law, where the persuasive burden falls upon the accused, the standard is proof on a balance of probabilities.\nWhenever a provision of law places an accused in a reverse onus (i.e., imposing a persuasive burden) to prove an essential element of an offence, the provision violates section 11(d) of the Charter. (Oakes)\nIn some cases, the violation might be saved under section 1; in some it may not.3\nii. Presumption of Innocence: #  Sources of the presumption of innocence can be found at common law (Woolmington), section 6 of the Criminal Code, and section 11(d) of the Charter, which guarantees the right:\n \u0026ldquo;to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.\u0026rdquo;\n The SCC in Oakes affirmed that the presumption of innocence in 11(d) requires the Crown to prove the elements of an offence beyond a reasonable doubt.\nIn Woolmington, the UK House of Lords held that once the Crown establishes a prima facie case for the elements of an offence, the burden does not shift to the accused to prove a defence. The burden remains on the Crown to prove that a defence does not apply.\nWoolmington and Oakes note an exception to this rule. An accused seeking to rely on the defence of mental disorder bears the onus of proving it (on a balance of probabilities).4\niii. The requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt #  The SCC in Lifchus held that \u0026lsquo;reasonable doubt\u0026rsquo; has a special meaning in law, which should be explained to juries:\n -it is not based on sympathy or prejudice\n-it is logically connected to the evidence or absence of it\n-it is based upon reason and common sense\n-it is not proof to an absolute certainty; it is not proof beyond any doubt, nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt\n-it is not met where accused is \u0026ldquo;probably guilty\u0026rdquo;\n In Starr, the SCC held that the reasonable doubt standard is \u0026ldquo;much closer to absolute certainty than to proof on a balance of probabilities\u0026rdquo;.\n  See Code section 348(2) for an example. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n See Code section 320.35 for an example. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n For example, the one in Chaulk is saved (mental disorder); the one in Oakes is not (intention for trafficking). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The burden also shifts to the accused where they seek to rely on other defences premised on a lack of voluntariness: extreme intoxication and automatism.

Key provisions in the Code include:4\n Purpose [of sentencing]\n718 The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:\n(a) to denounce unlawful conduct and the harm done to victims or to the community that is caused by unlawful conduct;\n(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;\n(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;\n(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;\n(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and\n(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims or to the community.\n\u0026lsquo;Fundamental Principle\u0026rsquo;\n718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\n  \u0026lsquo;Other Sentencing Principles\u0026rsquo;\n718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:\n(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,\n(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression, or on any other similar factor,\n(ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender\u0026rsquo;s intimate partner or a member of the victim or the offender\u0026rsquo;s family,\n(ii.1) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen years,\n(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim,\n(iii.1) evidence that the offence had a significant impact on the victim, considering their age and other personal circumstances, including their health and financial situation,\n(iv) evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organization,\n(v) evidence that the offence was a terrorism offence, or\n(vi) evidence that the offence was committed while the offender was subject to a conditional sentence order made under section 742.1 or released on parole, statutory release or unescorted temporary absence under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act\nshall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;\n(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;\n(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;\n(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and\n(e) all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders.\n   See, for example, s. 264 of the Code. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n For example, s 320.19(1)(b) imposes a mandatory fine of $1k for a first offence of impaired driving, if the Crown proceeds by summarily. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n For example, a conditional sentence is not available under circumstances set out in section 742.1. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n For the sake of brevity (and for exam purposes), we can omit sections 718.01 to 718.04. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "})})()
