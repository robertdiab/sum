      <description>Arrest and Detention Summary #  General points: #  Section 9 of the Charter guarantees everyone a right &amp;ldquo;not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.&amp;rdquo;
A detention will be arbitrary under s. 9 if it is not authorized by law, the law under which it is authorized is itself arbitrary, or the detention is not carried out in a reasonable manner (Le).
Police may question, but if not detained or under arrest, a person may refuse to cooperate (including ID, unless there is a legal requirement to provide this).</description>

      <description>Confessions Summary #  Preliminary Considerations: #  Was the accused&amp;rsquo;s statement a confession or &amp;lsquo;res gestae&amp;rsquo;?
Res gestae statements are those made spontaneously, during or soon after an offence takes place.
At common law, they are admissible and an exception to the voluntariness rule.
Where police obtain a statement from the accused that is not res gestae, the accused may challenge its admissibility on the basis that it was obtained contrary to (a) the common law Confessions Rule,</description>

      <description>Search and Seizure Summary #  Preliminary points: #  Section 8 of the Charter states:
&amp;ldquo;[e]veryone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.&amp;rdquo;
 In Hunter v Southam, the Supreme Court held that the purpose of section 8 is to protect a person&amp;rsquo;s right to a &amp;ldquo;reasonable expectation of privacy&amp;rdquo; (REP).
A person&amp;rsquo;s rights under section 8 are only engaged where the search by a state agent intrudes upon an REP.</description>

      <description>Overview of wiretap and electronic surveillance #  Preliminary points #  The Supreme Court held in Duarte and Wong that where police record a private conversation, they carry out a search. Part VI of the Code contains an extensive scheme for authorizing surveillance by state agents, though there are provisions in other parts of the Code allowing for other forms of surveillance or electronic monitoring (discussed below).
Part VI of the Code has three features.</description>

      <description>Summary of Exclusion Under 24(2) #  Where an accused establishes that a Charter right has been breached in the course of an investigation or prosecution, section 24(2) of the Charter allows for the exclusion of the evidence obtained as a consequence of the breach.
Section 24(2) states: &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;hellip;a court concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</description>
