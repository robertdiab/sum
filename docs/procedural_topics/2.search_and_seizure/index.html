  <p>Section 8 of the <em>Charter</em> states:</p>

<p>In <em>Hunter v Southam Inc</em>, the Supreme Court held that the purpose of

privacy&rdquo; (REP).</p>

<p>Section 32 of the <em>Charter</em> limits the application of the rights it protects to the actions of government and its agents. (<em>Dolphin Delivery</em>; <em>Vriend</em>)</p>
<p>In addition to police, section 8 applies to actors that are clearly part of government or entities over which government exerts substantial control (city bylaw officers, investigators for regulatory agencies, public transit security officers, or employees at public hospitals).</p>
<p>A person acts as an agent for police (or another state actor) where &lsquo;but for&rsquo; the involvement or direction of the police or state actor they would not have done what they did. (<em>Broyles</em>)</p>

  What is a search or seizure?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-is-a-search-or-seizure">#</a>

<p>A &lsquo;search&rsquo; under section 8 is anything done as an &lsquo;investigative
technique&rsquo; or with an investigative purpose that intrudes upon or diminishes a reasonable expectation of privacy. (<em>Evans</em>)</p>
<p>A &lsquo;seizure&rsquo; under section 8 is the &ldquo;taking of a thing from a person by a public authority without that person’s consent.&rdquo; (<em>Dyment</em>) (The thing taken must be something over which the person has an REP: <em>Dyment</em>, <em>Stillman</em>, <em>Patrick</em>.)</p>
<h3 id="when-do-we-have-an-rep">
  When do we have an REP?
  <a class="anchor" href="#when-do-we-have-an-rep">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The SCC in <em>Wong</em> held that whether we have an REP in a place or thing depends in a general sense on &ldquo;whether, by the standards of privacy that persons can expect to enjoy in a free and democratic society, the agents of the state were bound to conform to the requirements of the <em>Charter</em> when effecting the intrusion in question.&rdquo; In <em>Tessling</em>, the Court held that “[e]xpectation of privacy is a normative rather than a descriptive standard.”</p>
<p>For this reason, an item or place used for an illicit purpose does not preclude finding
an REP in it. (<em>Wong</em>)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The court will find an REP in a thing being searched where it touches upon a &ldquo;biographical core of personal information,&rdquo; or &ldquo;information which tends to reveal intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the individual.&rdquo; (<em>Plant</em>)</p>
<p>More broadly, in <em>Spencer</em> (2014) and <em>Marakah</em> (2017), the SCC held that whether a person has an REP in a thing or place depends on the &ldquo;totality of the circumstances,&rdquo; to be assessed under four &ldquo;lines of inquiry&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What was the subject matter of the alleged search? [a space, object,
conversation, device]</p>
<p>Did the claimant have a direct interest in the subject matter?
[ownership, direct involvement]</p>
<p>Did the claimant have a subjective expectation of privacy in the
subject matter?</p>
<p>If so, was the claimant&rsquo;s subjective expectation of privacy
objectively reasonable?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lack of control over a thing or space is does not preclude a court from finding that a person&rsquo;s expectation of privacy in the thing against the state was objectively reasonable. (<em>Cole</em>, <em>Reeves</em>, <em>Marakah</em>)</p>
<p>A person who sends a text or an email may, depending on the facts, retain a reasonable privacy interest in the message on the recipient&rsquo;s device. (<em>Marakah</em>)</p>
<p>A person who co-owns or shares a computer cannot waive the other person&rsquo;s privacy interest by consenting to its search or seizure. (<em>Cole</em>, <em>Reeves</em>)</p>
<p>Depending on the facts, a person can have a privacy interest in a residence they do not own or rent, or in a car in which they are a passenger. (<em>Edwards</em>, <em>Belnavis</em>, <em>Le</em>)</p>

  Assuming the Crown&rsquo;s theory to establish REP
  <a class="anchor" href="#assuming-the-crowns-theory-to-establish-rep">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In <em>R v Jones</em> (2017), the Supreme Court held that “an accused mounting a s. 8 claim may ask the court to assume as true any fact that the Crown has alleged or will allege in the prosecution against him in lieu of tendering evidence probative of those same facts in the voir dire.”</p>
<p>For example, if the Crown seeks to tender into evidence a gun seized from a bedroom in a home with an unknown occupant, on the theory that the accused occupied the room and possessed the gun, she need not establish these facts in the course of a challenge to the search or seizure under 8. She can ask the court to assume, for the purpose of the <em>Charter</em> challenge, that the room and the gun belonged to her.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="when-is-a-search-or-seizure-reasonable">
  When is a search or seizure reasonable?
  <a class="anchor" href="#when-is-a-search-or-seizure-reasonable">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If a state agent carries out what amounts to a search or seizure impinging upon an REP, the court then asks whether the search was reasonable.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in <em>Collins</em> held that <strong>a search will be reasonable</strong> under s. 8 if the <strong>Crown</strong> can establish on a balance of probabilities that:</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>(i) it is authorized by law,</p>
<p>(ii) the law is reasonable, and</p>
<p>(iii) the search is carried out in a reasonable manner.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="1-authorized-by-law">
  1. Authorized by Law
  <a class="anchor" href="#1-authorized-by-law">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A search or seizure may be authorized by a wide variety of possible law, including:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-a statutory provision providing for a <strong>warrant</strong> (typically on probable grounds);</p>
<p>-a statutory provision providing for a <strong>warrantless</strong> search or seizure, or one on lesser grounds;</p>
<p>-statutory or common law authority on <strong>exigent circumstances;</strong></p>
<p>-other <strong>common law</strong> authority (<em>e.g.</em>, ancillary police powers, sniffer dog searches, valid <strong>consent</strong>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(It matters not <em>which</em> law the officer or state agent had in mind when they acted. When a court assesses a search after the fact, it matters only that there <em>is</em> a law that authorizes what they did. The Crown can point to as many laws as they wish, as long as <em>one</em> of them authorizes what police did.)</p>
<h2 id="2-the-law-is-reasonable">
  2. The Law is Reasonable
  <a class="anchor" href="#2-the-law-is-reasonable">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In <em>Hunter</em>, the Supreme Court held that a law authorizing a search in the context of a criminal investigation will be reasonable where it requires a warrant (or prior authorization), issued by an independent party acting judicially, on the standard of reasonable and probable grounds (<em>i.e.</em>, reasonable grounds to believe an offence has been
committed and evidence is likely to be found in the place to be
searched).<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The Court in <em>Hunter</em> <strong>also</strong> held that a <strong>warrantless</strong> search is
<em>prima facie</em> unreasonable, but it may still be reasonable under section
8 in some circumstances.</p>
<p>To assess whether a (new) law authorizing a search is &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo;, a court must ask whether the law at issue strikes an appropriate balance between the state interest in search in that context and the privacy interest at issue. (<em>Hunter</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dickson J indicated in <em>Hunter</em> that in a context in which the state
has a heightened interest in search <strong>and</strong> a person&rsquo;s EP is
relatively low and the form of search authorized is not highly
invasive, it may be reasonable to depart from the 3 requirements in
<em>Hunter</em>&mdash;and to allow, for example, for a warrantless search on a
standard lower than RPG.</p>
<p>Conversely, where the EP is extremely high,
as in a strip search, section 8 may require a standard higher than RPG
to believe that evidence will be found (<em>e.g.</em>, for strip searches,
the additional belief that the search is necessary for safety or to
preserve evidence from imminent loss: <em>Golden</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Notable exceptions to the Hunter requirements</strong></p>
<p>The SCC has recognized as reasonable various departures from the
<em>Hunter</em> standards&mdash;in light of a lower privacy interest or a greater
state interest in the context, or both: including the &ldquo;ancillary police power&rdquo; at common law to carry out a <em>warrantless</em> search:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-incident to arrest (without additional grounds);</p>
<p>-incident to investigative detention (on reasonable suspicion
of safety concerns),</p>
<p>-using sniffer-dogs in a public space to sniff odours emanating from a
sealed item (on reasonable suspicion) (<em>Kang-Brown</em>, <em>A.M.;
Mackenzie</em>);<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>-a &lsquo;safety search&rsquo; (of a residence, a car) where police have
reasonable and probable grounds to believe there is an imminent threat
to public or police safety and the search is necessary to eliminate
the threat (<em>MacDonald</em>).<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also statutory provisions on exigent circumstances: 487.11 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> and 11(7) of the <em>CDSA</em> allowing police to conduct a warrantless search if the conditions for obtaining a warrant under 487(1) or 11(1) exist but due to exigent circumstances it is not practicable to obtain a warrant.</p>
<p>The SCC in <em>Grant</em> (1993), considering 11(7), held that: &ldquo;Exigent circumstances will generally be held to exist if there is an imminent danger of the loss, removal, destruction or disappearance of the evidence if the search or seizure is delayed.&rdquo; In <em>Paterson</em> (2017), the SCC added that exigent circs in 11(7) &ldquo;denotes not merely convenience&hellip; but rather <em>urgency</em>&rdquo; to act to preserve evidence or for officer or public safety.</p>
<p>Some forms of search or seizure without a warrant or without probable grounds have been held reasonable in the regulatory context.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="3-search-carried-out-in-a-reasonable-manner">
  3. Search Carried Out in a Reasonable Manner
  <a class="anchor" href="#3-search-carried-out-in-a-reasonable-manner">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The third part of <em>Collins</em> asks whether the practical, physical manner
in which the search was carried out was reasonable.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Examples of searches of a person carried out in an unreasonable manner include the facts in <em>Collins</em> (choke-hold) and <em>Golden</em> (unnecessary strip search in the field).</p>
<p><em>Hard entry with a warrant</em></p>
<p>In <em>Cornell</em> the Court affirmed a long-standing rule that except in exigent circumstances, police officers executing a warrant must make an announcement before forcing entry into a dwelling house. They should give notice of their presence by knocking or ringing the doorbell, identify themselves as law enforcement, and state their purpose by giving “a lawful reason for entry”.</p>
<p>When police depart from these rules, the Crown bears the onus of establishing police had “reasonable grounds to be concerned about the possibility of harm to themselves or occupants, or about the destruction of evidence.” (<em>Cornell</em>)</p>

  (i) Search Incident to Arrest
  <a class="anchor" href="#i-search-incident-to-arrest">#</a>
</h3>
<p><em>No additional grounds</em></p>
<p>At common law, when police carry out a lawful arrest, they also have
authority to carry out a limited search incident to arrest without
needing separate and additional grounds. (<em>Cloutier</em>, <em>Caslake</em>, <em>Fearon</em>)</p>
<p>Police may conduct a search incident to arrest before the detainee has a
chance to speak to a lawyer. (<em>Debot</em>)</p>
<p><em>Valid criminal justice objective</em></p>
<p>The Court in <em>Cloutier</em> and <em>Caslake</em> held that a search incident to arrest must be carried out for a &ldquo;valid objective in pursuit of the ends of criminal justice&rdquo;, such as:</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <ol>
<li>the discovery of an object that may be a threat to the safety of the police,
the accused or the public, or that may facilitate escape;</li>
<li>the discovery evidence against the accused;</li>
<li>the preservation of evidence from destruction.</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>

<p>A search incident to arrest may not be
conducted to intimidate or be carried out in an abusive manner.
(<em>Cloutier</em>)</p>
<p><em>Time and distance</em></p>
<p>Search of things seized upon arrest may also be carried out later in
time, or at a distance from the place of the arrest, if the search is
carried out for a valid criminal justice purpose connected to the
offence for which the person was arrested and there is a reasonable
explanation for the delay. (<em>Caslake</em>)</p>
<p><em>Truly incidental</em></p>
<p>Where there is an issue as to whether a search was truly <em>incidental</em> to
arrest (whether it was conducted for a criminal justice objective
<em>connected</em> to the offence for which the person was arrested), the court
will apply a twofold test:</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>(a) did the officer subjectively conduct the
search for a an objective connected to the reason for the arrest; and</p>
<p>(b) was this objectively reasonable in the circumstances? (<em>Caslake</em>)</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, in <em>Caslake</em>, the car was searched not to advance a
legitimate criminal justice objective, but merely as part of a police
policy to ensure the safekeeping of goods seized. The officer thus
lacked a subjective intent tied to the reason for the arrest. But if
he did act with this intention, it would have been objectively
reasonable, given the clear connection between the reason for the
arrest (PPT) and the possibility that drugs might be found in the car.
Conversely, if a person were arrested for shoplifting cigarettes and
the officer decided to conduct a search of the person&rsquo;s bag because
the officer subjectively believed it might contain drugs (acting on
the notion that &ldquo;the person looked to me like a drug dealer&rdquo;), the
officer&rsquo;s purpose for the search would not be <em>objectively</em> reasonable
since it would not advance a criminal justice objective <em>connected to
the reason for the arrest.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note that in practical terms, this two-part test is relevant only where
an accused raises an issue with <em>whether</em> a search was truly incidental
to an arrest &ndash; and thus it does not arise in <em>every</em> case involving a
search incident to arrest.)</p>
<h3 id="---scope-of-sita---bags-cars-area-within-home">
  &ndash; Scope of SITA - bags, cars, area within home
  <a class="anchor" href="#---scope-of-sita---bags-cars-area-within-home">#</a>
</h3>
<p>SITA may entail a brief pat down of clothing (but not the removal of clothing) and the search of pockets, bags, and &ldquo;immediate surroundings&rdquo; (<em>Cloutier</em>). The latter can
include the inside of a car in which (or close to which) a person is
arrested (<em>Caslake</em>).</p>
<p>In <em>Stairs</em>, the SCC recognized a power to search on arrest in a home the area “within the arrested person’s physical control at the time of the arrest” on no additional grounds. Police may also search the area “outside the arrested person’s physical control at the time of the arrest” but “sufficiently proximate to the arrest” where police have “reason to suspect that the search will further the objective of police and public safety, including the safety of the accused.”</p>
<h3 id="---search-of-phone-or-electronic-device-on-arrest">
  &ndash; Search of phone or electronic device on arrest
  <a class="anchor" href="#---search-of-phone-or-electronic-device-on-arrest">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In <em>Fearon,</em> the Supreme Court held that police may search a cell-phone
or electronic device incident to arrest (without a warrant) on four conditions:</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>i.  the arrest is lawful;</p>
<p>ii. the search is &lsquo;truly incidental to the arrest&rsquo;, meaning that it is
carried out promptly <strong>and</strong> in order to advance one or more of the
following law enforcement purposes: to protect the police, the
accused, or the public; to preserve evidence; or to discover
evidence&mdash;<strong>but</strong> a cellphone search on arrest for this third
purpose is only justified &ldquo;if the investigation will be stymied or
significantly hampered absent the ability to promptly conduct the
search&rdquo; [para 80];</p>
<p>iii. the nature and extent of the search is tailored to the law
enforcement purpose at issue (which in practice will generally mean
&ldquo;recently sent or drafted emails, texts, photos and the call log&rdquo;
but may reasonably include more, depending on the circumstances;
<strong>and</strong></p>
<p>iv. the police take detailed notes of what they examined on the device
and how.</p>

<h3 id="---strip-search-incident-to-arrest">
  &ndash; Strip search incident to arrest:
  <a class="anchor" href="#---strip-search-incident-to-arrest">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Police are authorized to carry out a strip search following an arrest
only where they have (in addition to the grounds for the arrest itself)
&ldquo;reasonable and probable grounds to believe it is necessary to carry out
a strip search in the circumstances of the arrest&rdquo; for (a) safety or (b)
to prevent evidence from being destroyed. (<em>Golden</em>)</p>
<p>A reasonable strip search is one conducted at the police station in
accordance with the guidelines set out in <em>R v Golden</em>, unless there are
exigent circumstances.</p>
<p>Police may carry out a strip search <em>in the field</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, at the scene of the
arrest) only where they can establish that, <strong>in addition</strong> to having
grounds for arrest <strong>and</strong> grounds for a strip search (described above),
they have <strong>further</strong> reasonable grounds to believe that exigent
circumstances make it necessary to carry out the search at that time and
place for safety or to prevent the loss of evidence. (<em>Golden</em>)</p>
<h3 id="ii-search-incident-to-investigative-detention">
  (ii) Search incident to Investigative Detention:
  <a class="anchor" href="#ii-search-incident-to-investigative-detention">#</a>
</h3>
<p>At common law, police have a power to search incident to investigative
detention, but it does not arise automatically upon a lawful
investigative detention. Police must have separate or additional
reasonable grounds to <em>suspect</em> that &ldquo;officer safety, or the safety of
others, is at risk.&rdquo; (<em>Mann</em>)</p>
<p>This must be based on more than a mere hunch or a &lsquo;personal intuition&rsquo;
about safety (<em>i.e.</em>, police must be able to point to evidence
supporting their belief as reasonable). (<em>Mann</em>)</p>
<p>The scope of the search may extend no further than what is necessary to
address concerns about safety. (<em>Grant</em>)</p>

  <a class="anchor" href="#appendix-2-search-analysis-in-a-conventional-criminal-case">#</a>
</h2>
<p>When assessing the validity of a search, courts apply the following
framework:</p>
<p>i.  <strong>Did the police seize or search something in which the accused had an REP?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Section 8 only protects a place or thing over which we have an REP:
<em>Hunter</em>)</p>
<p>[Onus on the accused to establish they had an REP on a balance of probabilities.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ii. <strong>Was the search reasonable?</strong></p>
<p>Pursuant to <em>Collins</em>, a search under s 8 is reasonable if the Crown establishes on a balance of probabilities that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i.  it was authorized by law</p>
<p>ii. the law is reasonable (in the sense of striking an appropriate
balance between the state&rsquo;s interest in search in this context and
the privacy interest at stake) [this is typically assumed, having been decided in an earlier case]; and</p>
<p>iii. the search was carried out in a reasonable manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="search-pursuant-to-a-warrant">
  Search pursuant to a warrant
  <a class="anchor" href="#search-pursuant-to-a-warrant">#</a>
</h3>
<p>A search conducted with a warrant will be one &ldquo;authorized by law&rdquo; if the warrant was validly issued (<em>i.e.</em>, in conformity with the requirements of the statutory provision) and the search conformed to the
scope of the warrant.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>A search with a warrant is typically challenged by arguing that the &lsquo;Information to Obtain&rsquo; the warrant (<em>i.e.</em>, the affidavit sworn by the officer setting out facts of the case) did not meet the (usual) standard of reasonable and probable grounds to believe an offence has been committed and evidence of it is likely to be found in the place to be searched (<em>e.g.</em>, s 487 of the Code).<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Another common argument for challenging a search with a warrant is that the &lsquo;Information to Obtain&rsquo; the warrant did not contain full and frank disclosure on the part of the police affiant, and that once important details left out are added or misleading ones are clarified or removed, the ITO doesn’t meet the requisite standard (<em>Araujo</em>).</p>
<p>(If the search was not lawful in relation to the warrant provision at issue, the Crown might still seek to establish it was authorized by some other law.)</p>
<h3 id="warrantless-search">
  Warrantless search
  <a class="anchor" href="#warrantless-search">#</a>
</h3>
<p>A warrantless search might be &lsquo;authorized by law&rsquo; under:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a.  a search power set out in a statute or at common law;<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<p>b.  exigent circumstances [<em>Code</em> 487.11, 529.3, etc.]; or</p>
<p>c. valid consent.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there was <strong>no</strong> authority for the search, or if the search does not
conform to any authority, the search was unreasonable and <strong>violates
section 8</strong>.</p>
<p>If there was other authority for the search and the search conforms with
it (and the law / authority in question is reasonable: <em>Collins</em> 2), the
court would then ask whether the search was carried out in a reasonable
manner? (<em>Collins</em> 3)</p>
<p>If it was, the search was reasonable and does not violate section 8; if
not, the search was unreasonable and violates section 8.</p>
<p>(Where section 8 has been breached, the court then moves on to the
question of exclusion under section 24(2) of the Charter &ndash; but do this
on an exam only if asked!)</p>
