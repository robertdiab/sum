  Eavesdropping:
  <a class="anchor" href="#eavesdropping">#</a>
</h2>
<p>It is not an offence for a civilian to record a conversation in which
they take part directly.</p>
<p>The situation is different for police officers. The Supreme Court held
in <em>Duarte</em> and <em>Fliss</em> that where police partake in a conversation
directly (<em>e.g.</em>, an undercover officer), they need a warrant to
<em>record</em> the conversation. (The recording by the state agent [but not
the conversation itself] constitutes a search over something private,
and therefore it must be authorized by law.)</p>
<p>Section 184(1) of the Code makes it an offence to &lsquo;intercept&rsquo; or
eavesdrop on a &lsquo;private communication&rsquo; between other people <em>with a
device</em>.</p>
<p>Section 183 defines &lsquo;private communication&rsquo; as an oral communication or
a &lsquo;telecommunication&rsquo; [a term defined in the <em>Interpretation Act</em> to be
anything transmitted by an &lsquo;electromagnetic system&rsquo;] by or to a person
in Canada where the originator reasonably expects that it will not be
received by anyone other than their intended recipient.</p>
<p>Section 183 also defines &lsquo;interception&rsquo; to mean record or listen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-thus, if you were simply eavesdropping on a conversation in the next
room, by pressing our ear to the door, you would not be committing the
offence under s. 184 &ndash; though you might be committing the tort of
&lsquo;invasion of privacy&rsquo; under section 1 of the <em>Privacy Act</em>, BC.</p>
<p>Section 184 requires an interception (listening or recording) <em>with a
device</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="interception-with-a-device">
  Interception with a device:
  <a class="anchor" href="#interception-with-a-device">#</a>
</h3>
<p>If we do want to intercept with a device:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>184(2) of the Code sets out a series of exceptions to the offence in
184(1). The two most important are:</p>
<p>i. if you have the consent of one of the parties to the conversation
you&rsquo;re intercepting</p>
<p>ii. if you have authorization</p>
<p>[Other exceptions are for telecom companies maintaining the system.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can police get around the need for an &lsquo;authorization&rsquo; in order to
lawfully conduct an interception (record or listen) if they have consent
from one party?</p>
<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>Police can rely only on consent if they only want to listen with a
device. If they want to record, they need authorization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(What about if police only want to listen <em>without</em> a device? The BCCA
has held that if police eavesdrop on a private conversation &mdash;
deliberately &mdash; they carry out a search [<em>Sandhu</em>, 1993]. They
would therefore need to be authorized by law to do this: a warrant or
other authority.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If police want to record a private conversation the provisions of this
part of the <em>Code</em> require, in some cases, that police have
authorization with consent, and in some cases, only authorization.</p>
<h3 id="authorization">
  Authorization
  <a class="anchor" href="#authorization">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Section 183 defines &lsquo;authorization&rsquo; in this part of the <em>Code</em> to
include various provisions allowing for interceptions, but they fall
within 3 categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i. 184.2(1) &mdash; allows for police interception (listening/recording)
if they have a warrant and consent. [also 184.3(6) by tele-warrant]</p>
<p>ii. third-party warrant provisions on probable cause and
&lsquo;investigative necessity&rsquo;: ss. 185 + 186 &mdash; allows for interception
(L/R) on a warrant and no consent.</p>
<p>iii. emergency authorizations &mdash; there are 3:</p>
<p>a. interception by a police officer or an &quot;agent of the state&quot; on
reasonable suspicion of risk of harm, BUT WITH the consent of one of
the parties (184.1(1).)</p>
<p>b. interception by a police office on probable grounds of imminent
harm &mdash; and no consent is required. (184.4)</p>
<p>c. an emergency third-party warrant under 188, by the Chief Justice
of the SC (no consent).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="other-surveillance-provisions">
  Other surveillance provisions
  <a class="anchor" href="#other-surveillance-provisions">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The <em>Code</em> contains a &lsquo;general warrant&rsquo; provision that allows for
surveillance or interception of private communication by any possible
means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>487.01(1) allows the police to obtain a warrant to use &ldquo;any device or
investigative technique or procedure or do any thing described in the
warrant that would, if not authorized, constitute an unreasonable
search or seizure in respect of a person or a person&rsquo;s property&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The provision requires reasonable and probable grounds (to believe an
offence has occurred and evidence is to be found in the place to be
searched); the warrant must be &lsquo;in the best interests of the admin of
justice&rsquo;; and there must be &ldquo;no other provision in this or any other
Act of Parliament that would provide for a warrant, authorization or
order permitting the technique, procedure or device to be used or the
thing to be done.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sections 487.01(4) and (5) address video surveillance specifically, and
require that if a warrant for video surveillance is issued under
487.01(1) &ldquo;shall contain such terms and conditions as the judge
considers advisable to ensure that the privacy of the person or of any
other person is respected as much as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="digital-surveillance">
  Digital surveillance
  <a class="anchor" href="#digital-surveillance">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In 2015, Parliament added to the <em>Code</em> powers to make:</p>
<h3 id="preservation-demands-487012">
  Preservation demands (487.012)
  <a class="anchor" href="#preservation-demands-487012">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Police can make a demand to a person/company without a warrant, on
reasonable suspicion, to preserve data in their possession or control
for 21 days.</p>
<h3 id="preservation-orders-487013">
  Preservation orders (487.013)
  <a class="anchor" href="#preservation-orders-487013">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Police can obtain an order from the court on reasonable suspicion
ordering a person/company to preserve data in their possession or
control to a max of 90 days &mdash; but the officer must either intend to or
be in the process of applying for a warrant for the data on RPG.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-warrants-4921">
  Tracking warrants (492.1)
  <a class="anchor" href="#tracking-warrants-4921">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Police can obtain a warrant to install a tracking device on any thing
carried or used by a person &mdash; or acquire GPS or other such data on a
device you already carry &mdash; on reasonable suspicion.</p>
<h3 id="transmission-data-warrants-4922">
  Transmission data warrants (492.2)
  <a class="anchor" href="#transmission-data-warrants-4922">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Allows police, on reasonable suspicion, to obtain subscriber information
or other &lsquo;envelop information&rsquo; (i.e., addressing or other info
accompanying a communication analogous to the info on the outside of an
envelop). This provision allows for the installation and monitoring of a
&lsquo;transmission data recorder&rsquo; to &ldquo;identify the type, direction, date,
time, duration, size, origin, destination or termination of a
communication&rdquo; &mdash; but it must not &ldquo;reveal the substance, meaning or
purpose of the communication.&rdquo; </p>
