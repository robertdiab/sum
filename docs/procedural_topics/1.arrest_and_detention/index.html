<p>Section 9 of the <em>Charter</em> guarantees everyone a right &ldquo;not to be
arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A detention will be arbitrary under s. 9 if it is not authorized by law,
the law under which it is authorized is itself arbitrary, or the
detention is not carried out in a reasonable manner (<em>Le</em>).</p>
<p>Police may question, but if not detained or under arrest, a person may
refuse to cooperate (including ID, unless there is a legal requirement
to provide this). (<em>Grant</em>, <em>Le</em>)</p>
<p>Police have the power to carry out an &lsquo;investigative detention&rsquo; where
they have a reasonable <em>suspicion</em> implicating the person in an offence
being investigated and where it is reasonably necessary on an objective
view of the totality of the circumstances (<em>Mann</em>). An investigative
detention triggers 10(a) and (b) of the <em>Charter</em> [more detail below].</p>
<p>Police also have the power to carry out a limited frisk <strong>search</strong>
incident to investigative detention where they have a reasonable
<em>suspicion</em> that safety is at risk.</p>
<p>Police may arrest on grounds set out in section 495(1) and in certain
other situations (under statute and common law: <em>e.g.</em>, breach of the
peace under s. 31 of the <em>Code</em> and at CL: <em>Hayes v Thompson</em>).</p>
<p>Police may carry out a limited search incident to arrest without
requiring further grounds. A strip search upon arrest requires
additional grounds, and a strip search at the scene of arrest requires
grounds in addition to those [more detail below].</p>
<h2 id="arrest-powers-under-the-criminal-code">
  Arrest powers under the <em>Criminal Code</em>:
  <a class="anchor" href="#arrest-powers-under-the-criminal-code">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Pursuant to section 495(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, a PO may arrest a
person where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that an
individual is subject to an arrest warrant, or has committed or is about
to commit an indictable offence [which includes a hybrid offence], or
if she finds a person committing <strong>any</strong> offence. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The Supreme Court in <em>Storrey</em> held that a valid arrest under s.
495(1)(a) requires that the officer to hold the &lsquo;reasonable belief&rsquo;
<em>subjectively</em> and that the belief be <em>objectively</em> reasonable, which is
to say &ldquo;a reasonable person, standing in the shoes of the police
officer, would have believed that reasonable and probable grounds
existed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Persons other than peace officers may arrest without a warrant anyone
they find committing an indictable office, <strong>or</strong> anyone they have
reasonable grounds to believe has committed a &lsquo;criminal offence&rsquo;
(summary or indictable) <strong>and</strong> is being freshly pursued by someone with
lawful authority to arrest: s. 494.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>A PO or civilian may use as much force as is reasonably necessary to
effect a lawful arrest, s. 25(1).</p>
<p>For a range of offences set out in section 495(2) [summary, hybrid, and
offences under s. 553], police must release a person immediately after
&ldquo;arrest&rdquo; (or in lieu of carrying out a full arrest) unless detaining
them further is necessary for any of the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; reasons set
out in s. 495(2) (ID, evidence, avoiding continuation/repetition of
offence, or to ensure court attendance).</p>
<p>Under section 529.3(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, police may enter a
dwelling house <strong>without a warrant</strong> in order to carry out an arrest
where they have reasonable grounds to believe the person is present and
the conditions are present to obtain a warrant under 529.1 (RPG) but due
to exigent circumstances this is not practicable. For the purposes of
this section, exigent circs are defined 529.3(2) to require (a)
reasonable grounds to <em>suspect</em> that it is necessary to prevent imminent
danger of bodily harm or death, <strong>or</strong> (b) reasonable grounds to
<em>believe</em> that entry is necessary to prevent against the <strong>imminent</strong>
loss or destruction of evidence of an <strong>indictable</strong> offence.</p>

<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>Police are authorized at common law to conduct a search incident to arrest where:</p>
<ol>
<li>the arrest is lawful;</li>
<li>the search is truly incidental to the arrest (i.e., conducted for a valid law enforcement purpose related to the reason for the arrest); and</li>
<li>the search is conducted reasonably.</li>
</ol>
<p>(<em>Fearon</em>)</p>

</blockquote>

<p><em>No additional grounds</em></p>
<p>At common law, when police carry out a lawful arrest, they also have
authority to carry out a limited search incident to arrest without
needing separate and additional grounds.</p>
<p><em>Scope of SITA</em></p>
<p>SITA may entail a brief pat down of clothing (but not the removal of clothing) and the search of pockets, bags, and &ldquo;immediate surroundings&rdquo; (<em>Cloutier</em>). The latter can
include the inside of a car in which (or close to which) a person is
arrested (<em>Caslake</em>).</p>
<p><em>Valid criminal justice objective</em></p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>The Court in <em>Cloutier</em> and <em>Caslake</em> held that a search incident to arrest must be carried out for a &ldquo;valid objective in pursuit of the ends of criminal justice&rdquo;, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>the discovery of an object that may be a threat to the safety of the police,
the accused or the public, or that may facilitate escape;</li>
<li>the discovery evidence against the accused;</li>
<li>the preservation of evidence from destruction.</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>

<p>A search incident to arrest may not be
conducted to intimidate or be carried out in an abusive manner.
(<em>Cloutier</em>)</p>
<p><em>Time and distance</em></p>
<p>Search of things seized upon arrest may also be carried out later in
time, or at a distance from the place of the arrest, if the search is
carried out for a valid criminal justice purpose connected to the
offence for which the person was arrested and there is a reasonable
explanation for the delay. (<em>Caslake</em>)</p>
<p><em>Truly incidental</em></p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>Where there is an issue as to whether a search was truly <em>incidental</em> to
arrest (whether it was conducted for a criminal justice objective
<em>connected</em> to the offence for which the person was arrested), the court
will apply a twofold test:</p>
<p>(a) did the officer subjectively conduct the
search for a an objective connected to the reason for the arrest; and</p>
<p>(b) was this objectively reasonable in the circumstances? (<em>Caslake</em>)</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, in <em>Caslake</em>, the car was searched not to advance a
legitimate criminal justice objective, but merely as part of a police
policy to ensure the safekeeping of goods seized. The officer thus
lacked a subjective intent tied to the reason for the arrest. But if
he did act with this intention, it would have been objectively
reasonable, given the clear connection between the reason for the
arrest (PPT) and the possibility that drugs might be found in the car.
Conversely, if a person were arrested for shoplifting cigarettes and
the officer decided to conduct a search of the person&rsquo;s bag because
the officer subjectively believed it might contain drugs (acting on
the notion that &ldquo;the person looked to me like a drug dealer&rdquo;), the
officer&rsquo;s purpose for the search would not be <em>objectively</em> reasonable
since it would not advance a criminal justice objective <em>connected to
the reason for the arrest.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note that in practical terms, this two-part test is relevant only where
an accused raises an issue with <em>whether</em> a search was truly incidental
to an arrest &ndash; and thus it does not arise in <em>every</em> case involving a
search incident to arrest.)</p>
<h3 id="---search-of-phone-or-electronic-device-on-arrest">
  &ndash; Search of phone or electronic device on arrest
  <a class="anchor" href="#---search-of-phone-or-electronic-device-on-arrest">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In <em>Fearon,</em> the Supreme Court held that police may search a cell-phone
or electronic device incident to arrest on four conditions:</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>i.  the arrest is lawful;</p>
<p>ii. the search is &lsquo;truly incidental to the arrest&rsquo;, meaning that it is
carried out promptly <strong>and</strong> in order to advance one or more of the
following law enforcement purposes: to protect the police, the
accused, or the public; to preserve evidence; or to discover
evidence&mdash;<strong>but</strong> a cellphone search on arrest for this third
purpose is only justified &ldquo;if the investigation will be stymied or
significantly hampered absent the ability to promptly conduct the
search&rdquo; [para 80];</p>
<p>iii. the nature and extent of the search is tailored to the law
enforcement purpose at issue (which in practice will generally mean
&ldquo;recently sent or drafted emails, texts, photos and the call log&rdquo;
but may reasonably include more, depending on the circumstances;
<strong>and</strong></p>
<p>iv. the police take detailed notes of what they examined on the device
and how.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Police may conduct a search incident to arrest before the detainee has a
chance to speak to a lawyer. (<em>Debot</em>)</p>
<h3 id="---strip-search-incident-to-arrest">
  &ndash; Strip search incident to arrest:
  <a class="anchor" href="#---strip-search-incident-to-arrest">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Police are authorized to carry out a strip search following an arrest
only where they have (in addition to the grounds for the arrest itself)
&ldquo;reasonable and probable grounds to believe it is necessary to carry out
a strip search in the circumstances of the arrest&rdquo; for (a) safety or (b)
to prevent evidence from being destroyed. (<em>Golden</em>)</p>
<p>A reasonable strip search is one conducted at the police station in
accordance with the guidelines set out in <em>R v Golden</em>, unless there are
exigent circumstances.</p>
<p>Police may carry out a strip search <em>in public</em> or <em>at the scene of the
arrest</em> only where they can establish that, <strong>in addition</strong> to having
grounds for arrest <strong>and</strong> grounds for a strip search (described above),
they have <strong>further</strong> reasonable grounds to believe that exigent
circumstances make it necessary to carry out the search at that time and
place for safety or to prevent the loss of evidence. (<em>Golden</em>)</p>
<h2 id="2-investigative-detention">
  2. Investigative Detention:
  <a class="anchor" href="#2-investigative-detention">#</a>
</h2>
<p>At common law, police have a power to detain a person briefly for
investigative purposes. A detention triggers a person&rsquo;s <em>Charter</em> rights
under sections 9 and 10(a) and (b). (<em>Mann</em>, <em>Grant</em>)</p>
<p>Police may carry out an &lsquo;investigative detention&rsquo; when they have (a) a
reasonable <em>suspicion</em> that the individual is implicated in the offence
being investigated and (b) where the detention is reasonably necessary
on an objective view of the totality of the circumstances. Factors to
consider here include &ldquo;the extent to which the interference with
individual liberty is necessary to perform the officer&rsquo;s duty [to
investigate crime], the liberty interfered with, and the nature and
extent of the interference.&rdquo; (<em>Mann</em>)</p>
<p>There must be a clear nexus, based in evidence, tying the <em>particular</em>
person detained to the offence being investigated (&ldquo;individualized
suspicion&rdquo;). Courts will assess whether an officer had a &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo;
suspicion by considering the reasonable person in the officer&rsquo;s
position. (<em>Mann</em>)</p>
<p>An investigative detention triggers both 10(a) and 10(b). Police must
inform the detainee, without delay, of the reason for the detention and
their right to retain counsel. But police may briefly delay discharging
their duties under 10(b) to carry out a safety search. (<em>Grant</em>,
<em>Suberu</em>)</p>
<p>Investigative detention is distinct from what the Supreme Court has
called &ldquo;preliminary investigative questioning.&rdquo; A person here is not
detained and police are not obliged to advise them that they do not have
to answer questions. (<em>Suberu</em>)</p>
<h3 id="---blockades">
  &ndash; Blockades
  <a class="anchor" href="#---blockades">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Court in <em>Clayton</em> held that police may set up a blockade and detain for investigative purposes persons if (a) doing so still involves individualized suspicion (or a nexus tying detainees to the offence being investigated) and (b) where it is reasonably necessary to do so based on the totality of the
circumstances, including:</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>i.  the nature of the situation (including the seriousness of the
offence);</p>
<p>ii. the information known to the police about the crime and/or the
suspects; and</p>
<p>iii. whether the stop/detention (<em>i.e.</em> geographic and temporal scope)
is reasonably tailored to the offence, and in balancing the risk to
the public versus the liberty of citizens, the stop is no more
intrusive than is &ldquo;reasonably necessary.&rdquo; (<em>Clayton</em>)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An investigative detention should be brief, but may be as broad (in time
or space) as is &ldquo;reasonably necessary in the totality of the
circumstances,&rdquo; so long as its purpose is restricted to investigating
the involvement in crime of particular suspects. (<em>Clayton)</em></p>
<h3 id="---test-for-whether-and-when-a-detention-has-occurred">
  &ndash; Test for whether and when a &lsquo;detention&rsquo; has occurred:
  <a class="anchor" href="#---test-for-whether-and-when-a-detention-has-occurred">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In <em>Grant</em>, the Supreme Court set out a test for deciding whether a
&ldquo;detention&rdquo; for the purpose of sections 9 and 10 has occurred. A person
is &ldquo;detained&rdquo; where there is <strong>significant</strong>:</p>
<p>a. physical restraint, or</p>
<p>b. psychological compulsion.</p>
<p>-psychological compulsion is established where there is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i. legal compulsion: where an officer makes a demand to comply
pursuant to statute: <em>eg</em>, a roadside breath demand; <strong>or</strong></p>
<p>ii. non-legal compulsion, which arises in circumstances where &ldquo;police
conduct would cause a <strong>reasonable</strong> person conclude that he or she
was not free to go and had to comply with the police direction or
demand.&rdquo; [The test is purely <strong>objective</strong>.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Court in <em>Grant</em> held that whether the reasonable person subject
to non-legal compulsion would conclude they were detained depends on
the following criteria considered in their totality:</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>i.  circumstances giving rise to the encounter as reasonably perceived
by the individual [were they subject to general inquiries or
singled out?];</p>
<p>ii. nature of the police conduct [language, duration, place, physical
contact, presence of others, etc.];</p>
<p>iii. particular characteristics/circumstances of the individual [age,
physical stature, sophistication, being a member of a racial
minority].</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Supreme Court in <em>Le</em> held that under the 3rd part of this test,
the reasonable person in the position of a racialized person is presumed
to be aware of the &ldquo;broader historical and social context of race
relations between the police and various racial groups and individuals
in society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the broader &lsquo;racialized context&rsquo; of a police encounter with a visible
minority, it is irrelevant whether the police involved engaged in racial
profiling when assessing whether the reasonable person would have
experienced significant compulsion.</p>
<p>In a given set of circumstances, a racialized accused might be more
likely than a white person to infer that they have no choice but to
comply with a police direction or demand &ndash; and this inference may be
reasonable in the circumstances, based on the weight of recent social
science evidence.</p>
<p>The detention analysis in <em>Grant</em> and <em>Le</em> is principally objective in
nature. (Evidence of what the police or the accused personally perceived
is important, but not determinative of whether the factors pointing to
psychological detention were, in their totality, <em>significant</em>.)</p>

  3. Search incident to Investigative Detention:

</h2>
<p>At common law, police have a power to search incident to investigative
detention, but it does not arise automatically upon a lawful
investigative detention. Police must have separate or additional
reasonable grounds to <em>suspect</em> that &ldquo;officer safety, or the safety of
others, is at risk.&rdquo; (<em>Mann</em>)</p>
<p>This must be based on more than a mere hunch or a &lsquo;personal intuition&rsquo;
about safety (<em>i.e.</em>, police must be able to point to evidence
supporting their belief as reasonable). (<em>Mann</em>)</p>
<p>The scope of the search may extend no further than what is necessary to
address concerns about safety. (<em>Grant</em>)</p>

  A note on standards:

</h2>
<p>The common law makes the following distinctions on standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;<strong>suspicion</strong>&rsquo; would be something merely <em>possible</em>, even if its
probability is low;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a &lsquo;<strong>reasonable suspicion</strong>&rsquo; would be a <em>reasonable possibility</em>, or
something not quite probable but more than hypothetical (SCC:
<em>Kang-Brown</em>, <em>Chehil</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;<strong>reasonable grounds to believe</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>reasonable belief</strong>&rsquo; have been
held by the SCC in <em>Debot</em> and <em>Baron</em> to be synonymous with
&lsquo;reasonable and probable grounds,&rsquo; and each is a way of saying there
is a <em>reasonable probability</em> of something<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;<strong>balance of probability</strong>&rsquo; means <em>greater likelihood</em> or &lsquo;more likely
than not&rsquo;.</p>

<p>This summary excludes details pertaining to powers of arrest of
property owners, and of civilians and police for breach of the
peace. Briefly, contrary to other civilians, property owners may
arrest a person they find committing a &lsquo;criminal offence&rsquo; (see s.
494(2) for further qualifications). Breach of the peace is not an
offence and involves actions that cause or are likely to cause harm
to persons or property. Civilians may detain for breaches they
witness (s. 30); police for this but also at CL for those
immediately imminent (s. 31 and <em>Thompson v Hayes</em>, BCCA 1985;
<em>Brown v Durham</em>, OCA 1998). <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Professor Coughlan reads the SCC decisions in <em>Debot</em>, <em>Baron</em>,
and <em>Storrey</em> as authority for the proposition that RPG means
balance of probabilities or &lsquo;more likely than not&rsquo;. But the cases do
not state this explicitly. They say RPG = reasonable probability,
which means &lsquo;likely&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;possible&rsquo;, and that RPG is less
than a &lsquo;prima facie case for conviction.&rsquo; The precise level of
certainty for RPG remains unclear. For an example of a recent court
decision outlining the state of this uncertainty, see paras 145-157
in <em>Can v Calgary (Police Service),</em> 2014 ABCA 322. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
