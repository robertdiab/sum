  <p>Section 8 of the <em>Charter</em> states:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[e]veryone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search
or seizure.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In <em>Hunter v Southam</em>, the Supreme Court held that the purpose of
section 8 is to protect a person&rsquo;s right to a &ldquo;reasonable expectation of
privacy&rdquo; (REP).</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s rights under section 8 are only engaged where the search by a
state agent intrudes upon an REP. (<em>Hunter</em>) (See below for more on
REP.)</p>
<p>A &lsquo;search&rsquo; under section 8 is anything done as an &lsquo;investigative
technique&rsquo; or with an investigative purpose. (<em>Evans</em>, SCC 1996)</p>
<p>Where a state agent carries out a search impinging upon an REP, the
court asks whether the search was reasonable. The Supreme Court in
<em>Collins</em> held that <strong>a search will be reasonable under s. 8 if</strong>:</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>(i) it is authorized by law,</p>
<p>(ii) the law is reasonable, and</p>
<p>(iii) the search is carried out in a reasonable manner.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="requirements-of-a-reasonable-search">
  Requirements of a &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; search:
  <a class="anchor" href="#requirements-of-a-reasonable-search">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In <em>Hunter</em>, the Supreme Court held a reasonable search is one conducted
pursuant to a warrant (or prior authorization), issued by an independent
party acting judicially, on the standard of reasonable and probable
grounds (<em>i.e.</em>, reasonable grounds to believe an offence has been
committed and evidence is likely to be found in the place to be
searched).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The Court in <em>Hunter</em> <strong>also</strong> held that a <strong>warrantless</strong> search is
<em>prima facie</em> unreasonable, but it may still be reasonable under section
8 in some circumstances.</p>
<p>A warrantless search may be reasonable if the Crown can demonstrate, on
a balance of probabilities, that it was carried out pursuant to other
law, the law is reasonable, and the search is carried out in a
reasonable manner. (<em>Collins</em>)</p>
<p>Other law authorizing a search includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-statutory or common law authority on <strong>exigent circumstances;</strong></p>
<p><strong>-other statutory provisions</strong> (<em>e.g.</em>, allowing for searches without
warrants and/or on lesser grounds in regulatory contexts); or</p>
<p>-other <strong>common law</strong> (<em>e.g.</em>, ancillary police powers, sniffer dog
searches, valid <strong>consent</strong>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To assess whether a (new) law authorizing a search is &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo;, the
court asks whether it strikes an appropriate balance between the state
interest in search in that context and the privacy interest at issue.
(<em>Hunter</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dickson J indicated in <em>Hunter</em> that in a context in which the state
has a heightened interest in search <strong>and</strong> a person&rsquo;s EP is
relatively low and the form of search authorized is not highly
invasive, it may be reasonable to depart from the 3 requirements in
<em>Hunter</em>&mdash;and to allow, for example, for a warrantless search on a
standard lower than RPG.</p>
<p>Conversely, where the EP is extremely high,
as in a strip search, section 8 may require a standard higher than RPG
to believe that evidence will be found (<em>e.g.</em>, for strip searches,
the additional belief that the search is necessary for safety or to
preserve evidence from imminent loss: <em>Golden</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third part of <em>Collins</em> asks whether the practical, physical manner
in which the search was carried out was reasonable.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="notable-exceptions-to-the-hunter-requirements">
  Notable exceptions to the Hunter requirements
  <a class="anchor" href="#notable-exceptions-to-the-hunter-requirements">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The SCC has recognized as reasonable various departures from the
<em>Hunter</em> standards&mdash;in light of a lower privacy interest or a greater
state interest in the context, or both: including</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-the &ldquo;ancillary police power&rdquo; at common law to carry out a:</p>
<p>-search incident to arrest (without additional grounds);</p>
<p>-search incident to investigative detention (on reasonable suspicion
of safety concerns),</p>
<p>-a sniffer-dog search in a public space of odors emanating from a
sealed item (on reasonable suspicion) (<em>Kang-Brown</em>, <em>A.M.;
Mackenzie</em>);<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>*-*a &lsquo;safety search&rsquo; (of a residence, a car) where police have
reasonable and probable grounds to believe there is an imminent threat
to public or police safety and the search is necessary to eliminate
the threat (<em>MacDonald</em>).<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>-statutory provisions allow for warrantless searches in exigent
circumstances: 487.11 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> and 11(7) of the <em>CDSA</em>:
both provisions state that a PO can carry out a warrantless search if
the conditions for obtaining a warrant under 487(1) or 11(1) exist but
due to exigent circumstances it is not practicable to obtain a
warrant.</p>
<p>The SCC in <em>Grant</em> (1993), considering 11(7), held that: &ldquo;Exigent
circumstances will generally be held to exist if there is an imminent
danger of the loss, removal, destruction or disappearance of the
evidence if the search or seizure is delayed.&rdquo; In <em>Paterson</em> (2017),
the SCC added that exigent circs in 11(7) &ldquo;denotes not merely
convenience&hellip; but rather <em>urgency</em>&rdquo; to act to preserve evidence or
for officer or public safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="when-do-we-have-a-rep">
  When do we have a REP?
  <a class="anchor" href="#when-do-we-have-a-rep">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The SCC has set out several tests for REP, among them the following
three (the first being the most general and authoritative).</p>
<p>The test set out in <em>Spencer</em> (2014) and <em>Marakah</em> (2017):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether a person has an REP in a thing/place depends on the &ldquo;totality
of the circumstances,&rdquo; to be assessed under four &ldquo;lines of inquiry&rdquo;:</p>
<p>What was the subject matter of the alleged search? [a space, object,
conversation, device]</p>
<p>Did the claimant have a direct interest in the subject matter?
[ownership, direct involvement]</p>
<p>Did the claimant have a subjective expectation of privacy in the
subject matter?</p>
<p>If so, was the claimant&rsquo;s subjective expectation of privacy
objectively reasonable?<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A second test, relating primarily to &ldquo;informational&rdquo; forms of privacy,
involves an assessment of whether the thing being searched reveals a
&ldquo;biographical core of personal information,&rdquo; or &ldquo;information which tends
to reveal intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the
individual.&rdquo; (<em>Plant</em>)</p>
<p>A third test, set out in <em>Wong</em> holds that whether we have an REP in a place / thing depends in a general sense on &ldquo;whether, by the standards of privacy that persons can expect to enjoy in a free and democratic society, the agents of the state were bound to conform to the requirements of the <em>Charter</em> when effecting the intrusion in question.&rdquo; (<em>Wong</em>) The question is thus normative rather than descriptive.</p>
<p>An item or place used for an illicit purpose does not preclude finding
an REP in it. (<em>Wong</em>)<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="search-analysis-in-a-conventional-criminal-case">
  Search analysis in a conventional criminal case:
  <a class="anchor" href="#search-analysis-in-a-conventional-criminal-case">#</a>
</h2>
<p>When assessing the validity of a search, courts apply the following
framework:</p>
<p>i.  Did the accused have an REP in the place or thing searched/seized?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Section 8 only protects a place or thing over which we have an REP:
<em>Hunter</em>)</p>
<p>[Onus on the accused on a balance of probabilities.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ii. Was the search reasonable?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to <em>Collins</em>, a search under s 8 is reasonable if:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i.  it was authorized by law</p>
<p>ii. the law is reasonable (in the sense of striking an appropriate
balance between the state&rsquo;s interest in search in this context and
the privacy interest at stake); and</p>
<p>iii. the search was carried out in a reasonable manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Onus on the Crown on all 3 points here on a balance of
probabilities.]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="search-pursuant-to-a-warrant">
  Search pursuant to a warrant
  <a class="anchor" href="#search-pursuant-to-a-warrant">#</a>
</h3>
<p>A search conducted with a warrant will be one &ldquo;authorized by law&rdquo; only
if the warrant was validly issued (<em>i.e.</em>, in conformity with the
requirements of the statutory provision) and the search conformed to the
scope of the warrant?<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>If a home (or any other space) were searched without a warrant, the
search would be <em>prima facie</em> unreasonable and might still be reasonable
(applying the test in <em>Collins</em>).</p>
<h3 id="warrantless-search">
  Warrantless search
  <a class="anchor" href="#warrantless-search">#</a>
</h3>
<p>A warrantless search might be &lsquo;authorized by law&rsquo; under:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a.  a search power set out in a statute or at common law;<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>b.  exigent circumstances [<em>Code</em> 487.11, 529.3, etc.]; or</p>
<p>c. valid consent.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there was <strong>no</strong> authority for the search, or if the search does not
conform to any authority, the search was unreasonable and <strong>violates
section 8</strong>.</p>
<p>If there was other authority for the search and the search conforms with
it (and the law / authority in question is reasonable: <em>Collins</em> 2), the
court would then ask whether the search was carried out in a reasonable
manner? (<em>Collins</em> 3)</p>
<p>If it was, the search was reasonable and does not violate section 8; if
not, the search was unreasonable and violates section 8.</p>
<p>(Where section 8 has been breached, the court then moves on to the
question of exclusion under section 24(2) of the Charter &ndash; but do this
on an exam only if asked!)</p>
