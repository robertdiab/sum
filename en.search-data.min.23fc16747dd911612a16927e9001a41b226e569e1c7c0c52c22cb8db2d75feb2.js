Actus Reus",section:"Substantive Topics",content:"Summary of law on Actus Reus #  General points on actus reus: #  The actus reus can be defined as \u0026ldquo;a physically voluntary act or omission.\u0026rdquo;\nFor an offence to be committed, the actus reus and mens rea must be concurrent\u0026mdash;on the principle that if not, courts would punish either conduct without fault or guilty intent not expressed in guilty action.\nThe actus reus of an offence must be carried out voluntarily and can include the failure to act.\nThe principle of legality requires that the actus reus for a criminal offence is set out in an offence (enacted and published) at the time it was committed, and that the definition of the offence not be overbroad or vague. (The principle is partially entrenched in 11(g) of the Charter.)\nThe Principle of Concurrency: #  As a general principle, the actus reus and mens rea must concur. (Fagan, Cooper)\nThey need not be \u0026ldquo;completely concurrent\u0026rdquo; throughout the commission of an offence but must coincide \u0026ldquo;at some point.\u0026rdquo; (Cooper)\nCourts may take an expansive view of when the actus reus is completed: a \u0026ldquo;series of acts [or omissions] may form part of the same transaction.\u0026rdquo; (Cooper)\nAn act (or an omission) carried out unintentionally at first can be \u0026ldquo;adopted\u0026rdquo; by a later decision not to act to rectify it. If an act is continuous, a person\u0026rsquo;s adoption of an earlier omission or unintentional act will constitute a concurrence of the actus reus and mens rea. (Miller)\nVoluntariness: #  The actus reus must be committed voluntarily. (Kilbride, King)\nVoluntariness entails \u0026ldquo;conscious control of action\u0026rdquo; or action that is the \u0026ldquo;product of conscious choice.\u0026rdquo; This is premised on the belief that it would be unfair and unjust to punish persons for conduct they did not choose or could not physically control. (Kilbride, King)\nAt common law, \u0026ldquo;a person is presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of their actions.\u0026rdquo; Thus, where an accused carries out a basic act, forming one or more elements of the actus reus\u0026mdash;for example, pushing or punching another person\u0026mdash;he or she is presumed to have acted voluntarily. (Bernard, Daviault)\nAn accused may raise a doubt about whether she acted voluntarily by adducing evidence that, at the time of the offence, she was affected by mental or physical disorders or conditions, including sleepwalking, concussion, delirium, epileptic seizure, or involuntary intoxication.\nThe concept of voluntariness in Canadian criminal law refers to choice and control over physical actions. In Ruzic, the SCC recognized that acts carried out under necessity or duress are \u0026ldquo;morally involuntary.\u0026rdquo; The Court in Ruzic and Hibbert also held that, in contrast to physical involuntariness, moral involuntariness does not negate the actus reus or the mens rea. It may, however, excuse the acts (if the elements of the defence of necessity or duress are made out), thus resulting in an acquittal.\nOmissions: #  A failure to act can form the basis of criminal liability only where the failure constitutes the breach of a legal duty to act.\nThere is no general legal duty in Canadian criminal law to be a good Samaritan: i.e., to assist someone in distress, or prevent a crime from occurring or continuing\u0026mdash;even when one can do so easily and without risk or disadvantage.\nA number of Code provisions criminalize omissions on the basis of duties set out in the offence provision itself\u0026mdash;for example, section 129(b): failing to assist a police officer when requested, or section 252(1): failing to stop, give ID, and render assistance after being involved in an accident.\nOther offence provisions include as part of the actus reus the breach of a legal duty set out elsewhere in the law: e.g.,\n -s. 180(2) \u0026ndash; common nuisance: \u0026ldquo;Everyone commits a common nuisance who does an unlawful act or fails to discharge a legal duty and thereby (a) endangers lives, safety, health, property or comfort of the public \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n-s. 220 \u0026ndash; criminal negligence causing death. This offence draws on the definition of criminal negligence in 219:\n(1) Everyone is criminally negligent who\n (a) in doing anything, or\n (b) in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do,\nshows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.\n(2) For the purposes of this section, \u0026ldquo;duty\u0026rdquo; means a duty imposed by law.\n The Code itself contains provisions that set out legal duties that can be applied under sections 180 or 219, including:\n -s. 216 \u0026ndash; setting out a duty of persons to use reasonable care in undertaking acts that may endanger life.\n-s. 217 \u0026ndash; stating: \u0026ldquo;Everyone who undertakes to do an act is under a legal duty to do it if an omission to do the act is or may be dangerous to life.\u0026rdquo;\n The Ontario Court of Appeal in Thornton held that the legal duty referred to in section 180(2) can be found in either federal or provincial statutes or at common law. It also held that a valid duty in this context is the one set out in Donoghue v. Stevenson to \u0026ldquo;take reasonable care not to injure one\u0026rsquo;s neighbour.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal in Brown held that for the purposes of section 217, an \u0026ldquo;undertaking\u0026rdquo; requires a commitment to do something that is \u0026ldquo;clearly made and with binding intent.\u0026rdquo; The \u0026ldquo;mere expression of words indicating a willingness to act\u0026rdquo; will not suffice.\nConsequences and Causation: #  General points:\nWhere the actus reus of an offence includes the element of causation (\u0026ldquo;dangerous driving causing death\u0026rdquo;), the Crown must prove causation BARD.\nIf the accused\u0026rsquo;s actions are the direct or main cause (i.e., the factual cause), then causation is made out. No need to go further.\nBut if the accused\u0026rsquo;s actions are only a contributing cause, the court must consider whether those actions are the \u0026lsquo;legal cause.\u0026rsquo; The test for legal causation is whether the actions of the accused were a \u0026ldquo;contributing cause beyond the de minimus\u0026quot;.Â (Smithers)\nLegal causation refers to a person\u0026rsquo;s moral responsibility for a prohibited consequence where his or her acts were a significant cause but not necessarily the only or main cause. (Smithers, Nette)\nTest for legal causation: #  The test for legal causation in criminal law was reformulated in Nette: the act at issue must be \u0026ldquo;a significant contributing cause.\u0026rdquo; The majority of the SCC in Nette held that this was a preferable way of formulating the same (or equally acceptable) test set out earlier in Smithers (\u0026ldquo;a contributing cause beyond the de minimus\u0026quot;).\nLegal and factual causes may be distinct, with the accused\u0026rsquo;s acts forming only one of two or more operative causes. (Smithers, Harbottle)\nThe accused\u0026rsquo;s conduct therefore need not be the \u0026ldquo;sole cause,\u0026rdquo; the \u0026ldquo;main cause,\u0026rdquo; or even a \u0026ldquo;substantial cause\u0026rdquo; in order to be the legal cause. (Smithers)\nIntervening acts\nAn intervening act may interrupt the causal chain between the accused and the harm inflicted, raising a reasonable doubt about whether the accused\u0026rsquo;s original act was a \u0026lsquo;significant contributing cause.\u0026rsquo; (Harbottle, Maybin)\nThe SCC in Maybin held that courts may consider one or both of two possible \u0026lsquo;lines of inquiry\u0026rsquo; to assess whether an intervening act or event severs the causal link between the accused\u0026rsquo;s actions and the consequence at issue (or raises a doubt about this):\n  was the event reasonably foreseeable from the act of the accused \u0026ndash; not the specific act, but the general nature of it; and/or\n  was the event a response to the accused\u0026rsquo;s act or was it an independent, intentional act that overwhelmed the act of the accused?\n  (The Court also held that the main test remains the one in Smithers/Nette.)\n The Smithers/Nette test applies to all offences, including manslaughter and murder*,* with the exception of \u0026lsquo;constructive\u0026rsquo; first-degree murder under sections 231(5) and (6) noted below (or unless the offence provision provides otherwise).\nThe requirement to establish causation is a principle of fundamental justice under section 7 of the Charter, as part of the broader principle that the morally innocent should not be punished.\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal has held that the Smithers' de minimus test does not offend fundamental justice by setting too low a threshold for proof of causation, given the fact that for more serious crimes such as manslaughter, the Crown must also establish objective foreseeability of a risk of bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory. (Cribben)\nCausation and murder: #  For the forms of first-degree murder set out in sections 231(5) and (6) (or where similar terms are used), the test for causation is whether the accused\u0026rsquo;s conduct was \u0026ldquo;a substantial and integral cause of death\u0026rdquo;. (Harbottle, Nette)\nFor all other forms of murder (i.e., first and second degree), the test for causation is the one set out in Smithers/Nette.\n"}),a.add({id:1,href:'/sum/docs/substantive_topics/2.-mens_rea/',title:"2. Mens Rea",section:"Substantive Topics",content:"Summary of law on Mens Rea #  General points on mens rea: #  There is no single kind or level of fault that applies to all criminal or regulatory offences.\nThe Supreme Court has held that it is a principle of fundamental justice under section 7 of the Charter that a person should not be convicted of a criminal offence without the Crown having to prove a fault element, and one that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence. (Creighton)\nSection 7 does not therefore require that a conviction for a criminal offence rest on proof of subjective mens rea. It requires proof of a fault element, and the fault element need only attach to a blameworthy element of the actus reus. For most crimes, objective mens rea is constitutionally sufficient, so long as it is commensurate to the gravity of the offence. (DeSousa, Creighton)\n\u0026lsquo;Special stigma crimes\u0026rsquo; are a partial exception. The Court has identified a category of offences to be \u0026lsquo;special stigma\u0026rsquo; offences, based on their stigma and penalty. In Vaillancourt, the Court held that it is a principle of fundamental justice that a person cannot be convicted of such an offence without proof of \u0026ldquo;a mens rea reflecting the particular nature of the crime.\u0026rdquo; For theft: proof of dishonesty; for murder: proof of subjective foresight of death.\nIn the case of a negligence-based criminal offence, section 7 requires proof of the accused\u0026rsquo;s failure to be aware of a risk arising from conduct amounting to a marked departure from the standard of the reasonable person. (Creighton)\nSection 7 requires that any offence that may result in a deprivation of liberty (jail, probation) cannot be an absolute liability offence. A regulatory offence with penal consequences must either require proof of fault or allow for proof of a lack of fault (as in strict liability). (BC Motor Vehicle Reference)\nCommon law presumptions about the fault element: #  Where an offence provision is silent on mens rea, the common law presumes that a certain level of fault is required, depending on whether the offence is criminal or regulatory in nature.\n-an offence can be inferred to be \u0026ldquo;criminal\u0026rdquo; where it:\n -carries a serious penalty or stigma; and/or\n-absolutely prohibits and punishes inherently wrongful conduct.\n -an offence can be inferred to be \u0026ldquo;regulatory\u0026rdquo; where it:\n -appears in either a provincial or federal statute;\n-its predominant purpose is the regulation of a risk or the prevention of harm to public welfare through the requirement to abide by a minimum standard of care or conduct; and\n-carries a relatively low penalty and stigma (i.e., a jail sentence of roughly 3 years or less)\n(Beaver, Pierce, Sault Ste. Marie, Wholesale Travel)\n Offences in the Criminal Code are presumed to be criminal. (Prue, Buzzanga) The same presumption arguably extends to offences in other criminal law statutes such as the CDSA and the YCJA.\nIf an offence is a criminal offence and is silent as to mens rea, there is a presumption at common law that the offence requires the Crown to prove a subjective form of mens rea (intent, knowledge, willful blindness or recklessness) for each element of the actus reus. (Sault Ste. Marie, Buzzanga, R v ADH [SCC 2013])\nIn the case of offences (aside from murder) that include aggravated assault, unlawful act causing bodily harm and unlawful act manslaughter, the Supreme Court has held that a distinct fault element may attach to the assault or unlawful act (subjective or objective mens rea, as the case may be), but the fault element in relation to the prohibited consequence (bodily harm, death, etc.) may be as low as \u0026lsquo;objective foreseeability of non-trivial harm.\u0026rsquo; (DeSousa, Creighton)\nIf the offence is a criminal offence, the burden rests on the Crown to prove the requisite mens rea.\nWhere an offence is a regulatory offence and is silent as to the requisite fault element, there is a presumption that it is a strict liability offence. In this case, the Crown is required to prove only the actus reus BARD and negligence is inferred from this in the absence of proof on the part of the accused (on a balance of probabilities) that he or she took reasonable care to avoid the prohibited consequence. (Sault Ste. Marie)\nNot all regulatory offences are either strict or absolute liability. There is a presumption that regulatory offences are strict liability where the offence provision is silent as to mens rea. There is a further presumption that an offence is one of absolutely liability only where Parliament or the legislature makes this intention clear through either explicit language or other indications, such as subject matter or context (regulatory, minor penalty, no stigma). However, Parliament and provincial legislatures can also create a regulatory offence that requires the Crown to prove a mens rea element, either subjective or objective (e.g., knowledge, intent, reasonable foreseeability, etc.) by including language to this effect. (Sault Ste. Marie, Stasser)\nHierarchy of forms of mens rea or fault: #  1. full or subjective MR\n2. objective foresight or knowledge (the accused ought to have known a consequence would follow)\n3. criminal negligence (occurs only where offence is pursuant to ss. 219, 220, or 221)\n4. penal negligence (criminal offence involving a departure from a standard: e.g., careless use of a firearm)\n5. strict liability (Crown proves AR, accused may establish defence of due diligence or incapacity)\n6. absolute liability (Crown proves AR, no fault necessary)\n Subjective mens rea: #  If a criminal offence contains a specific term or phrase such as \u0026ldquo;with intent,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;wilfully,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;knowingly,\u0026rdquo; etc., this will generally exclude lower forms of mens rea. For example, a provision requiring that a prohibited consequence be committed intentionally, willfully, or on purpose will exclude knowledge, wilful blindness, or recklessness as alternate forms of mens rea. (Buzzanga; Chartrand, SCC 1994)\nWhere a provision requires the proof of intention or wilfulness, the Crown may prove this by establishing either:\n i. direct intent: i.e., that the accused consciously or deliberately intended to bring about the prohibited consequence.\n(For example, in the offence of \u0026lsquo;wilfully promoting hatred\u0026rsquo;: a person intends to communicate and also directly/explicitly intends for his communication to promote hatred)\nii. indirect intent: i.e., that the accused intended to do one thing but subjectively foresaw that a prohibited consequence was certain or substantially certain to follow from it.1\n(For example, communicating something that is substantially certain to promote hatred \u0026ndash; here a person may intend only to communicate something satirical, but where he also foresees that it is substantially certain to promote hatred as well, he is deemed to have intended to promote hatred too, even though his immediate intention might only have been to communicate a satirical message.)\n In both cases the accused will be found to have intended the prohibited consequence. (Buzzanga)\nWhere an offence requires that something be done \u0026lsquo;for the purpose\u0026rsquo; of achieving a prohibited result, the Crown need only prove that a person acted intentionally or deliberately in effecting that result. The Crown need not prove that the person also desired it. Conversely, where a person carries out a certain act deliberately but does not desire that it be done (killing, assault, etc.), she does not thereby negate the intentional character of her act (but she may rely on the defence of duress). (Hibbert)\nRecklessness is a subjective form of mens rea in which a person is aware of a risk (of a prohibited result) but decides to take it. (Sansregret)\nWilful blindness is a form of mens rea in which a person becomes aware of the need for some inquiry but declines to make it (or is \u0026ldquo;deliberately ignorant\u0026rdquo;). (Sansregret, Duong, Briscoe)\nWB requires a strong suspicion of a prohibited consequence, combined with a deliberate choice not to inquire so as to avoid being fixed with knowledge. The fault lies not in failing to inquire but choosing not to when a strong suspicion is aroused. (Briscoe)\nWherever knowledge is an element of the fault component for an offence, wilful blindness may substitute. (Briscoe)\nIf wilful blindness substitutes for the knowledge element in a charge of murder it requires \u0026ndash; for either the principal or the party \u0026ndash; not just a \u0026lsquo;strong suspicion of a prohibited consequence\u0026rsquo; but awareness that death is likely. (Roach, Sankoff and Manning)\nWhether a person was reckless or wilfully blind does not involve a consideration of the perspective of the reasonable person. Where an offence requires proof of recklessness or wilful blindness, the question for the trier of fact is not whether the accused ought to have been aware of a risk, or ought to have made an inquiry, but rather, whether she was personally aware of a risk or deliberately ignorant of the need for an inquiry. (Sansregret, Briscoe)\nObjective forms of mens rea: #  Objective forms of mens rea are offences in which one or another part of the fault element of the offence is assessed in terms of the reasonable person.\nThe form or level of objective fault may vary depending on the offence. Some offences require only \u0026lsquo;objective knowledge,\u0026rsquo; or the reasonable person\u0026rsquo;s awareness of the risk of a prohibited consequence. Other offences employ the concept of negligence and are assessed in terms of the accused\u0026rsquo;s departure from the standard of care of the reasonable person.\nCriminal offences that involve the concept of negligence take two forms. \u0026ldquo;Criminal negligence\u0026rdquo; refers exclusively to the offences set out in sections 219, 220, and 221. These hold a person criminally responsible for either their awareness of or failure to be aware of the risk arising from conduct amounting to a marked and substantial departure from the standard of care the reasonable person and their failure to avoid it where the reasonable person in their circumstances would have been able to.\nBy contrast, all other criminal offences that involve negligence (i.e., the departure from a standard of care) are referred to as \u0026ldquo;penal negligence\u0026rdquo; offences. A person is held responsible under these offences for the same awareness or failure to be aware of a risk arising from their conduct as in \u0026ldquo;criminal negligence\u0026rdquo; offences, but here the standard is simply conduct amounting to a marked departure from that of the reasonable person.\nFor all criminal offences involving objective forms of fault, the onus remains on the Crown to prove mens rea.\nBy contrast, the Supreme Court in Wholesale Travel held that the minimum level of fault required in order for a regulatory offence carrying a prison sentence to be consistent with section 7 of the Charter is negligence simplicitor. (Thus, a provincial offence leading to jail can rest on strict liability.)\nIn a strict liability offence, negligence may be inferred from the actus reus in the absence of proof that the accused acted with reasonable care (due diligence). The Crown need not prove a fault element \u0026ndash; it suffices for the negligence to be inferred from the actus reus with the persuasive burden shifting to the accused to prove a lack of negligence. (Wholesale Travel)\nIn criminal offences involving an objective form of fault, courts apply a \u0026ldquo;modified objective test,\u0026rdquo; which asks whether the risk raised by the conduct at issue would have been foreseeable to the reasonable person in the same circumstances of the accused \u0026ndash; but without the reasonable person sharing the personal characteristics of the accused such as age, education, and experience. (Creighton)\ni. Objective foresight or knowledge: #  Forms of objective fault are found in a variety of offences. For example, some might require that a person \u0026ldquo;knew or ought to have known\u0026rdquo; something. Some offences of objective fault entail a dual structure where part of the actus reus might require subjective (or objective) fault but the prohibited consequence requires only objective foresight of non-trivial harm. Examples of this include manslaughter, unlawful act causing bodily harm, and assault causing bodily harm.\nIn the case of manslaughter (by unlawful act) or unlawful act causing bodily harm (s. 269), the Crown must prove the mens rea for the unlawful act (intent for assault), along with objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm beyond the trivial or the transitory. (Creighton, DeSousa)\nii. Penal and criminal negligence: #  In Creighton, the Court set out a general framework for assessing the actus reus and mens rea for penal negligence offences:\n Actus reus: an act or omission constituting a marked departure from the conduct of the reasonably prudent person in the circumstances.\nMens rea: (a) awareness of the risk arising from conduct amounting to a marked departure from that of the reasonable person in the circumstances; or\n(b) the failure to be aware of this risk where it was objectively foreseeable (which may be inferred from the actus reus absent evidence of incapacity or a reasonable mistake of fact).\n To be clear, where the actus reus has been proved (i.e., conduct amounting to a marked departure), the accused bears an evidentiary but not a persuasive burden with respect to the defences of incapacity and mistake of fact. The accused can thus raise a doubt about whether the reasonable person in her circumstances would have been aware of the risk by virtue of adducing some evidence of:\n i. incapacity (i.e., the accused suffered some physical or mental incapacity that would have prevented the reasonable person, suffering the same condition, from appreciating the risk posed by the conduct at issue, or abiding by a reasonable standard of care); or\nii. an honest and reasonable belief in a mistaken fact. (Creighton, Beatty)\n For either defence, once the evidentiary burden is met (some evidence), the persuasive burden remains on the Crown to prove BARD that incapacity or mistake of fact do not apply (i.e., there is no reasonable possibility that they do apply). (See note on mistake of fact below.)\nThe Supreme Court in R v JF confirmed that a similar framework applies to criminal negligence (s. 219):\n Actus reus: an act or omission \u0026ldquo;showing wanton and reckless disregard\u0026rdquo; for the lives or safety of others, which is assessed on the basis of whether the conduct in question constituted a marked and substantial departure from the standard of care of the reasonable person in the circumstances [+ causing either bodily harm or death, depending on whether person is charged under section 220 or 221].\nMens rea: (a) awareness of the risk to lives or safety of others arising from conduct amounting to a marked and substantial departure from that of the reasonable person in the circumstances; or\n(b) the failure to be aware of this risk where it was objectively foreseeable (which may be inferred from the actus reus absent evidence of incapacity or a reasonable mistake of fact).\n The defences to criminal negligence would operate in the same fashion as those for penal negligence offences, as noted above.\nThe Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Beatty entails a slight exception to this framework for negligence-based criminal offences in that it holds that the actus reus for dangerous driving in s. 249 is driving that is \u0026ldquo;objectively dangerous, having regard to all the circumstances.\u0026rdquo; The SCC in Roy held that to establish the mens rea under 249, the Crown must prove that the reasonable person in the circumstances would have foreseen the risk arising from the driving and taken steps to avoid it, or that the accused\u0026rsquo;s failure to foresee the risk and take steps to avoid it constituted a marked departure from the standard of care of the reasonable driver (absent evidence of incapacity or a reasonable mistake of fact).\nIn a series of cases dealing with penal negligence, the Supreme Court has held that given the criminal nature of these offences, section 7 of the Charter requires at least proof on the part of the Crown of negligence to the standard of a marked departure. Put otherwise, the minimal constitutional standard of negligence for a criminal offence is proof of conduct amounting to a marked departure from the standard of care of the reasonable person\u0026mdash;and either the accused\u0026rsquo;s awareness of this or their failure to be aware in circumstances in which the reasonable person would have been aware. (Creighton, Hundal, Beatty)\nStrict Liability: #  Where a regulatory offence is silent as to mens rea, there is a presumption that it is a strict liability offence. (Sault Ste-Marie)\nIn a strict liability offence, the Crown must prove only the actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused may raise a doubt about the actus reus by adducing evidence that the act was involuntary (or by raising a doubt about whether it was voluntary). (S.S. Marie)\nIn a strict liability offence, once the Crown has proved the actus reus, the accused is entitled to an acquittal if he can establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he:\ni. took all reasonable care to avoid the event (due diligence); or\nii. reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts. (S.S. Marie, Wholesale Travel)\nIn assessing reasonable care or reasonable mistake of fact here, \u0026ldquo;the Court considers circumstances that the reasonable person would have seen, not the circumstances that the accused actually perceived.\u0026rdquo; (K. Roach, Criminal Law, 5^th^ edition.)\nPlacing the accused in this reverse onus violates 11(d) of the Charter but is justified under s. 1 on the basis of the importance of strict liability offences as a means of advancing public policy objectives and the difficulty of requiring the Crown to prove negligence in cases of this nature. (Wholesale Travel)\nAbsolute Liability: #  In an absolute liability offence, the Crown need only prove the actus reus (beyond a reasonable doubt). The accused may raise a doubt whether the actus reus has been proved and/or was carried out voluntarily.\nAn offence is presumed not to involve absolute liability unless Parliament or the legislature makes this intention clear through explicit language, or if the subject matter or context implies this. (Levis, Sault Ste. Marie)\nAn absolute liability offence that gives rise to the possibility of imprisonment or other deprivations of liberty (probation) violates section 7 of the Charter and is not justified under section 1. (B.C. Motor Vehicle Reference)\nAn absolute liability offence may be defended by seeking to raise a doubt about whether the actus reus was committed voluntarily due to automatism, mental disorder, extreme intoxication, or necessity. The defence of mistake of fact (even if reasonable) is not available. (Hickey, OCA 1976; K. Roach, Criminal Law, 5^th^ edition.)\nConstitutional Considerations: #  The Supreme Court has held that certain offences carry a \u0026ldquo;special stigma\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; possibly involving the penalty attached to them, but not necessarily \u0026ndash; and that the principles of fundamental justice require proof of a level of fault commensurate with this stigma. A conviction for theft would require \u0026ldquo;proof of some dishonesty,\u0026rdquo; for murder, proof of \u0026ldquo;subjective foresight\u0026rdquo; of death. (Vaillancourt, Martineau)\nA conviction for murder cannot be based on proof of an objective form of fault, i.e., what the accused \u0026ldquo;ought to have known\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ought to have foreseen.\u0026rdquo; (Martineau)\nIn the case of \u0026lsquo;war crimes\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;crimes against humanity,\u0026rsquo; fundamental justice requires more than the mens rea for the various crimes committed as part of these offences (murder, kidnapping, etc.). It also requires additional subjective mens rea of the fact that the actions in question are carried out in circumstances which bring the offence within the definition of war crimes or crimes against humanity. (Finta)\nNote on the defence of \u0026lsquo;mistake of fact\u0026rsquo; #  Mistake of fact is a defence in the sense that it may form the basis of a reasonable doubt about mens rea rather than serving as a justification or excuse where elements of the offence have been established.\nIn the case of full or subjective mens rea offences, an honest but mistaken belief in a fact may raise a doubt about mens rea even if the belief is not reasonable.\nIn the case of subjective mens rea offences, \u0026ldquo;the existence or non-existence of reasonable grounds\u0026rdquo; for a mistaken belief \u0026ldquo;is merely relevant evidence to be weighed\u0026rdquo; by the trier of fact in assessing whether the belief was honestly held. (Rees)\nIn the context of sexual assault (a subjective mens rea offence), the operation of this rule has been qualified by section 273.2(b) which states that an accused may not rely on a mistaken belief in consent unless he or she can establish that they took \u0026ldquo;reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the case of negligence-based and objective mens rea offences (objective foresight), mistake of fact is available as a defence but subject to the requirement that the mistaken fact be both honestly held and reasonable (i.e., in the eyes of the reasonable person).\nEvidentiary and Persuasive Burdens in Mistake of Fact: #  For full subjective and objective fault criminal offences: #  The accused bears an evidentiary but not a persuasive burden to rely on this defence. The test for an evidentiary burden in the case of defences generally is that the accused must simply raise some evidence for each element of the defence on which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could acquit if it believed the evidence to be true (or in this case, if it believed the mistake was honestly held [and also, for objective fault offences, reasonable]).\nOnce the evidentiary burden is met (i.e., \u0026lsquo;some evidence for each element\u0026rsquo;), the Crown must prove BARD that the mistake was either not honestly held or, in the context of an objective fault offence, not honestly held or not reasonable or both. (i.e., that there is no reasonable possibility that\u0026hellip;)\nFor strict liability: #  The Crown bears a burden to prove only the actus reus BARD, and then both the evidentiary and persuasive burdens shift to the accused to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that she took reasonable steps to avoid the conduct at issue or acted on the basis of a belief, honestly and reasonably held, amounting to a mistake of fact.\n  Note that in some cases the Code or statute may provide otherwise: e.g., section 429(1) of the Code states that in Part XI of the Code, a person may do something \u0026lsquo;wilfully\u0026rsquo; where she acts with knowledge that a prohibited consequence is only probable. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "}),a.add({id:2,href:'/sum/docs/substantive_topics/3.-participation_offences/',title:"3. Participation Offences",section:"Substantive Topics",content:"Summary of Participation offences #  Overview #  This summary includes:\n1. Counselling\n2. Conspiracy\n3. Attempts\n4. Parties\n5. Accessory After the Fact\n6. Final Points\n 1. Counselling: #  Section 22(1) makes a person a party to an offence where they counsel a person to commit an act that is an offence, and that person commits it.\nSection 22(2) makes a person a party to an offence where they counsel a person to commit an act that is an offence and the person commits another offence that was reasonably foreseeable from the act counselled. (This allows for a criminal conviction on an objective standard and is thus likely invalid under section 7 in many cases.)\nCounselling can be defined as the act of telling, persuading, inciting, procuring, or soliciting another to commit an act that is an offence. (Hamilton)\nSection 464 sets out the distinct offence of \u0026ldquo;counselling an offence that is not committed.\u0026rdquo; It renders the jeopardy of a person who counsels to be the same as that of an attempt to commit the offence counselled (i.e., half the jeopardy of the indictable offence; the same if it\u0026rsquo;s summary).\nThe elements of counselling a crime that is committed: s 22(1) #   Actus reus: active inducement or encouragement to do an act that is an offence + the offence being committed or an offence that is reasonably foreseeable from the act counseled.\nMens rea: the accused intentionally counsels (encourages / induces) and intends that the act be committed or knows that it likely will be. (Janeteas, for both elements)\n The elements of counselling a crime that is not committed: s 464 #   Actus reus: active inducement or encouragement of the commission of a criminal offence.\nMens rea: intent that the offence counselled be committed, or knowingly counseling when aware of an unjustified risk that the offence is likely to be committed. (Hamilton for both elements)\n(The Court in Hamilton distinguishes the second element of the mens rea from mere recklessness on the basis that it requires an awareness not of the possibility but of the likelihood that the offence will be committed.)\n 2. Conspiracy: #  Codified in s 465 but defined at common law, \u0026lsquo;conspiracy\u0026rsquo; consists in an agreement (tacit or express) between two or more persons to commit an offence. The offence lies in the fact of the agreement and a common intention (between two or more persons) to put the common design into effect. No further acts or elements are necessary.\nThe actus reus of conspiracy [in a prosecution against a single conspirator] is the fact of the agreement between the accused and one or more other persons to commit an offence and the intention on the part of at least two or more of the parties (including the accused) to carry out the planned offence.\n (\u0026quot;\u0026hellip;[E]ach of the conspirators must have a genuine intention to participate in the agreement.\u0026quot; Dynar\nThe offence is thus unusual in the sense that a co-conspirator\u0026rsquo;s intention or mental state is part of the AR of the offence against the accused.)\n The mens rea is the accused\u0026rsquo;s intention to enter into the agreement and his or her intention to put the common design into effect.\nTo convict either or both parties to a conspiracy, the Crown must prove that there was an agreement between two or more, and that both intended to carry it out; mere words by one party (e.g., an undercover officer) would not suffice to establish an agreement. (O' Brien)\nThere must be a \u0026lsquo;common design\u0026rsquo; or some general agreement about the nature of the offence to be committed (\u0026ldquo;a common purpose of a single enterprise\u0026rdquo;), though there may be changes to the plan over time. (Cotroni).\nA conspiracy is not established simply on the basis of proof of knowledge of the plan, or of participation in it. (i.e., the Crown is required to prove an agreement: an intent, among two or more, to enter into it the scheme and to carry it out.)\n3. Attempts: #  Section 24(1) sets out the offence of attempting to commit an offence and renders a person culpable for the offence regardless of whether it was (factually) impossible to it.\nElements of attempt #   Actus reus: going beyond mere preparation to commit the offence. (Deutch)\nMens rea: an intention to commit the predicate offence. (Ancio)\n Points from the case law #  On the actus reus:\n An act goes \u0026ldquo;beyond mere preparation\u0026rdquo; in law when a person takes the first step toward committing the offence after preparation is complete. (Cline)\nThe question of whether preparation is complete is qualitative, with no clear line between mere preparation and attempt; where it is unclear whether preparation was complete, a court should assess the relative proximity of the steps taken to the complete offence, in terms of time, location, and acts to be completed. (Deutsch)\nWhere actions (possibly amounting to attempt) are, on their face, equivocal, the mens rea for committing the offence (or attempting to) cannot be inferred. (Sorrell and Bondet)\nThe general attempt provision, section 24(1), precludes as a defence the claim that it was factually impossible to commit the complete offence (reaching into a pocket to steal a wallet that wasn\u0026rsquo;t there). This left uncertain whether section 24(1) still allows for the defence of legal impossibility (if I tried to steal an umbrella that turned out to be mine, it would not have been a crime in law). The Supreme Court in Dynar held the distinction between these two forms of impossibility to be untenable: they are both essentially forms of factual impossibility.\nIn place of the distinction between factual and legal impossibility, the SCC in Dynar held that the only relevant distinction to draw here is one between factually impossible offences and \u0026lsquo;imaginary crimes.\u0026rsquo; Only the latter are a defence to attempt, distinguished where the fault element in the offence refers to a mens rea not known to Canadian law.\nFor example*,* where you reach into a pocket to steal a wallet that isn\u0026rsquo;t there or try to steal an umbrella that happens to be yours, you have the *mens rea* for theft. If you smuggle sugar into Canada **knowing** it to be sugar but believing it to be a crime to \u0026lsquo;import sugar\u0026rsquo;, you do not have the *mens rea* of an offence under Canadian law.\n Points from the case law on the mens rea of attempt:\n Where an offence might require a lesser form of mens rea to obtain a conviction for the complete offence (recklessness, knowledge, etc.), a conviction for attempting to commit that offence will require nothing less than the intention to carry out the complete offence (all elements). (Ancio, Williams)\n(e.g., murder allows for a conviction where there is either an intent to kill or an intent to do bodily harm that the accused knows is likely to cause death; but for attempted murder, subjective foresight of death will not suffice. A conviction requires an intent to cause death. Similarly, while aggravated assault requires only subjective fault for assault + objective foreseeability of the aggravated consequences (maiming, endangerment, etc.), the offence of \u0026lsquo;attempted aggravated assault\u0026rsquo; requires an intent to cause maiming, endangerment, etc.)\n 4. Parties #  Section 21 renders a person a party to an offence where he or she aids or abets a principal offender (21(1)) or forms an intention in common intention to carry out an unlawful purpose (21(2)).\nAiding means assisting or helping; abetting means encouraging, instigating, or promoting. (Briscoe, Greyeyes)\nElements of Aiding in s. 21(1)(b): #  The Court set these out in Briscoe:\n The actus reus of aiding is doing or omitting to do something to assist in the commission of an offence.\nThe mens rea of aiding has two parts:\na. an intent to assist the principal in committing the offence; and\nb. knowledge of the type of offence the principal intends to commit \u0026gt; (but not the precise manner).\n Willful blindness may substitute here for knowledge. (Briscoe)\nElements of Abetting in s. 21(1)(c) #  The actus reus of abetting is encouraging another to commit the offence.\nThe mens rea is intentionally or knowingly encouraging a person to commit the offence.\nIn the case of murder, a party either aiding or abetting would require the additional element of \u0026ldquo;knowledge that death is likely.\u0026rdquo; (Martineau, Kirkness)\nIn the case of being a party to attempt murder, the mens rea for aiding or abetting would be intending to do something to aid or abet and knowledge that the principal will likely do something with the intent to kill. (Drawing from Logan on knowledge for attempt murder under 21(2).)\nPoints from the case law on s. 21(1) #  A person neither aids nor abets a crime for being merely present at the scene of a crime in circumstances consistent with innocence. Nor do they become a party for failing to prevent a crime, so long as they are not under a duty to act. (Dunlop and Sylvester, Jackson)\nAiding or abetting require more than mere presence. This can include encouragement, facilitation (keeping watch, holding victim down), or preventing interference with the criminal act. (Dunlop and Sylvester)\nPresence may amount to aiding or abetting where a person had prior knowledge of the principal\u0026rsquo;s intent to commit the offence or where they attended for the purpose of encouraging. (Dunlop and Sylvester)\nA person\u0026rsquo;s presence may also support a finding of aiding or abetting based on the totality of factors including the accused\u0026rsquo;s apprehension at the scene, the Court\u0026rsquo;s rejection of his explanation for being there, the nature of the offence, the context in which it was committed, or other circumstantial evidence of guilt. (Jackson)\nA court may convict a person as a party where the elements of the offence under s. 21(1)(a),(b), or (c) or 21(2) can be established, even though the identity of the principal is unknown, or the precise role played by the party and the principal in the commission of the offence is unclear. (Thatcher)\nIn such a case, the jury need not be unanimous as to whether the accused was a party or a principal, so long as jury members are in agreement that the evidence proves BARD that he was one or the other. (Thatcher)\nA person who aids or abets only a purchaser cannot be convicted as a party to trafficking under section 5 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. But a person who aids both a purchaser and a seller, can be found guilty of being a party to trafficking \u0026ndash; even though she worked primarily with or on behalf of the purchaser. (Greyeyes)\nCommon intent, s. 21(2): #  Under section 21(2), where a person forms an intention in common with another person to carry out an unlawful purpose (an act that is a criminal offence) and to assist the other person in carrying it out, he or she is liable (as a party) for offences committed by the other person that he or she knew or ought to have known would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose.\n Actus reus: forming of an intent in common to carry out an unlawful purpose (a criminal act) and to assist each other in carrying it out, along with the offence being carried out or any reasonably foreseeable offence (or lesser included offence).\nMens rea: an intention to carry out the unlawful purpose and to assist the other person(s) therein, along with knowledge or objective foreseeability that the (actual) offence would be carried out. (Hibbert)\n The objective element of the mens rea in 21(2) does not apply to a party to a murder or attempt murder. (A conviction based on objective mens rea in the case of murder or attempt murder violates section 7: Martineau, Logan.)\nThe mens rea for murder under 21(2) is the same as is set out above, except the knowledge element would be: knowledge that death would likely result from the unlawful purpose that two or more parties intend to carry out. (Martineau, Logan)\nIn the case of being a party to attempt murder under 21(2), the mens rea is: forming an intent to carry out an unlawful purpose + an intent to assist another therein + knowledge that the principal will likely do something with the intent to kill. (Logan)\n A person charged as a party to murder or attempt murder under section 21(2) may be liable for a lesser included offence such as manslaughter or assault (i.e., if they intended to carry out an act that gives rise to the reasonable possibility of causing bodily harm beyond the trivial or transitory: Creighton, Logan).\n 5. Accessory after the fact #  Section 23 makes it an offence to receive, comfort, or assist a person that one knows has been a party to an offence for purpose of enabling them to escape.\n Actus reus: receiving, comforting, or assisting a fugitive.\nMens rea has two components:\ni. subjective knowledge that the fugitive has been a party to an offence; and\nii. assisting the fugitive for the purpose of helping him escape.\n Willful blindness may serve as a substitute for the knowledge element here. (Duong)\nThe actus reus requires a positive act (receiving, comforting, etc.) rather than just a failure to inform authorities about a fugitive\u0026rsquo;s whereabouts. (Dumont)\nAdvising a fugitive that police had their names and licence numbers is sufficient for the actus reus. (Young, QCA)\nIt will not suffice to prove that acts of assistance had the effect of helping a fugitive to escape; the Crown must also prove that they were done for this purpose. (McVay)\nTo establish that the fugitive \u0026lsquo;has been a party to an offence\u0026rsquo;, the Crown must prove that the fugitive has committed the actus reus of that offence. (R v. S(FJ))1\nThe accused can be convicted of being an accessory after the fact even if the principal was acquitted. (s. 23.1 and Shalaan, SCC 1998)\n6. Final points: #  A person accused of being either a party to an offence or attempting an offence may invoke the doctrine of abandonment to raise a doubt as to whether they had the requisite mens rea. In the case of attempt, the accused must abandon before they have moved \u0026lsquo;beyond mere preparation\u0026rsquo;.\nTest for abandoment #  In R v Gauthier, the SCC set out a four-part test for abandonment: the accused must establish an an air of reality that they:\n(i) had an intent to withdraw;\n(ii) gave timely notice to the principal(s);\n(iii) gave unequivocal notice; and\n(iv) took reasonable steps to neutralize or cancel out the effective of their participation in a manner proportionate to their involvement in the offence.\n Once the evidentiary burden is met for each element of this test, the Crown the (persuasive) burden to establish BARD that one or more element does not apply.\nWhere the principal cannot be convicted: s 23.1 #  Section 23.1 of the Code states that a person may be convicted under sections 21 to 23 (i.e., as a party for aiding, abetting, forming an intention in common; for counselling; or as an accessory after the fact) despite the fact that the person whom they aid, abet, form an intent in common with, counsel, or assist as an accessory cannot be convicted of the offence.\n  Section 657.2(2) of the Code states that evidence from a prosecution of another person for the offence is admissible against the accused and \u0026ldquo;in the absence of evidence to the contrary is proof that the offence was committed.\u0026rdquo; \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "}),a.add({id:3,href:'/sum/docs/substantive_topics/4.-homicide/',title:"4. Homicide",section:"Substantive Topics",content:"Summary of Homicide #  General points: #  Section 222 of the Criminal Code defines homicide as directly or indirectly causing the death of a human being. The Code sets out four forms of homicide: non-culpable, murder, manslaughter or infanticide.\nSection 234 states \u0026ldquo;culpable homicide that is not murder or infanticide is manslaughter.\u0026rdquo;\nInfanticide functions as both an offence (mother killing baby when still suffering post-partum effects) and a partial defence to murder (lowering murder to manslaughter).\nManslaughter may be punished up to life and has no mandatory minimum sentence, except with use of a firearm, which carries a 4-year minimum.\nMurder carries a mandatory life sentence, with a minimum 10-year parole ineligibility period for second degree, and 25 years of ineligibility for first degree. (Different rules apply to a \u0026lsquo;young person\u0026rsquo; who commits murder, even when sentenced as an adult.)\nManslaughter #  The most common forms of manslaughter are set out in section 222(5):\n -section 222(5)(a) causing death by an unlawful act;1 or\n-section 222(5)(b) by criminal negligence.\n Unlawful act manslaughter: #  The actus reus of unlawful act manslaughter is an unlawful act that causes death. The unlawful act may consist of any federal or provincial offence other than an absolute liability offence, and one that entails a risk of bodily harm.2 (DeSousa)\nThe mens rea for unlawful act manslaughter is (a) the fault element for the unlawful act and (b) objective foreseeability of a risk of bodily harm beyond the trivial or transitory. (Creighton)\nThe reasonable person in this test (as in all objective fault offences) is one who is in the same circumstances as the accused and shares only the characteristics of the accused that would render her unable to appreciate the risk (i.e., the same incapacities as the accused). (Creighton)\nManslaughter caused by criminal negligence (s 220) #   Actus reus: An act or omission \u0026ldquo;showing wanton and reckless disregard\u0026rdquo; for the lives or safety of others, which is assessed on the basis of whether the conduct in question constituted a marked and substantial departure from the standard of care of the reasonable person in the circumstances + causing death.\nMens rea: (a) awareness of the risk presented by this conduct or (b) the failure to be aware of the risk where it was objectively foreseeable, and absent evidence of incapacity or a reasonable mistake of fact. (R. v. J(F))\n Murder #  Section 229 sets out four ways to commit murder: i. 229(a)(i) causing death where the accused means to cause death;\nii. 229(a)(ii) causing death where the accused means to cause bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause death;\niii. 229(b) where the accused means to cause death or bodily harm (that he knows is likely to cause death) in relation to one person but by accident or mistake kills another; or\niv. 229(c) where a person pursuing an unlawful object does anything that he knows is likely to cause death and causes death despite the fact that he desired to effect the unlawful object without causing death or bodily harm.\n Knowledge that harm is \u0026ldquo;likely to cause death\u0026rdquo; in section 229(a)(ii) means knowledge that death is \u0026ldquo;probable\u0026rdquo; and not simply a possibility, a risk, or a chance. (Roks)\nCausation for murder: #  In addition to special rules for causation in sections 224 to 226 of the Code, which apply to all forms of culpable homicide, the general common law test for causation applies to murder: \u0026ldquo;a significant contributing cause.\u0026rdquo; (Nette)\nThis test also applies to section 231(2), which states generally that \u0026ldquo;Murder is first degree murder when it is planned and deliberate\u0026rdquo;, and to provisions which raise to first degree the murdering of a police officer (231(4)) and murder in the case of a contract killing (231(3)).\nA distinct causation test applies to provisions that raise second degree murder to first degree which contain the phrase \u0026ldquo;caused by that person\u0026rdquo; found in sections 231(5), 231(6), 231(6.01), (6.1), and (6.2): i.e., where death is intentionally caused during a sexual assault, kidnapping, hostage taking, criminal harassment, terrorism, etc.\nFor these provisions, the accused\u0026rsquo;s actions must be a \u0026ldquo;substantial and integral cause\u0026rdquo; (Harbottle).\n First degree murder: #  First degree murder is not a distinct offence but a classification of a form of murder for sentencing purposes. (The Crown must first establish the elements for murder.)\nMurder is first degree murder when it is planned and deliberate. (Section 231(2))\n -planned means a \u0026ldquo;calculated scheme or design\u0026rdquo; though either can be simple. A murder may be \u0026ldquo;planned\u0026rdquo; even if it is immediately carried out. (Widdifield)\n-deliberate means \u0026ldquo;slow in deciding,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;considered,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;not impulsive.\u0026rdquo; (More)\n-murder can be \u0026ldquo;planned and deliberate\u0026rdquo; even where it entails a plan to inflict bodily harm with knowledge that it is likely to cause death. (Nygaard)\n A murder will be first degree under section 231(5) if death is caused \u0026ldquo;while committing\u0026rdquo; a series of offences including sexual assault and unlawful confinement. The victim of the murder need not be the victim of the listed offence. (Russell)\nWhere an accused has the mens rea for murder, and the murder is planned and deliberate but the accused by accident kills another person, that act is murder in the first degree. (Droste)\nWhere murder is raised from second to first degree under section 231(4) (murder of a peace officer in execution of duty, among other circumstances), the Crown must prove subjective knowledge of the facts in the provision (i.e., the victim was an officer in the execution of his duty, etc.). (Collins)\nAll murder that is not first degree murder is second degree. (Section 231(7))\n  An unlawful act causing death might also be murder or infanticide, if the elements for those offences are made out (the elements are set out in sections 229 and 233, respectively). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s holdings in Creighton and DeSousa suggest that if the unlawful act here is a strict liability offence, the court should read in the standard of penal negligence: i.e., the Crown must prove BARD that the unlawful act constituted a marked departure from the conduct of the reasonable person. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "}),a.add({id:4,href:'/sum/docs/substantive_topics/5.-provocation/',title:"5. Provocation",section:"Substantive Topics",content:"Summary of Provocation #  General points: #  Section 232(1) states: \u0026ldquo;Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.\u0026rdquo;\nSection 232(2) defines provocation as follows: \u0026ldquo;Conduct of the victim that would constitute an indictable offence under this Act that is punishable by five or more years of imprisonment and that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section, if the accused acted on it on the sudden and before there was time for their passion to cool.\u0026rdquo;\nProvocation does not apply to an act the accused has provoked or an act that arises from the victim\u0026rsquo;s exercise of a legal right\u0026mdash;i.e., an officer carrying out a lawful arrest. (232(3))\nPrior to 2015, the portion of section 232(2) underlined above was not part of the provision. Instead of the portion underlined above, the provision defined provocation as a \u0026lsquo;wrongful act or insult\u0026rsquo; by the victim that would cause an ordinary person to lose the power of self-control, with the accused acting on the sudden and before there was time for their passions to cool.\nIn 2019, the BC Supreme Court, in R v Simard held that the words added to 232(2) in the 2015 amendments violate section 7 of the Charter (and the SCC dismissed a direct application for leave to appeal this decision). What follows is a summary of the law remaining valid in BC.\nElements of the defence of provocation set out in R v. Hill:\n(1) Would an ordinary person be deprived of self-control by the victim\u0026rsquo;s act? (objective)\n(2) Did A in fact act lose control as a result of these provocative acts? (subjective)\n(3) Was A\u0026rsquo;s response sudden and before there was time for passions to cool? (subjective)\n The question at stage 1 is not whether the ordinary person would have done what the accused did but whether the act would have provoked them to lose the power of self-control. (Hill)\nBefore the defence may be put to the jury, the accused must raise an air of reality for each element of the defence (i.e., there must be some evidence on which a jury, acting reasonably, might conclude that the accused\u0026rsquo;s response was \u0026ldquo;sudden and before her passions had cooled\u0026rdquo; [or whatever the element requires]).\nOnce an air of reality has been established, the burden shifts to the Crown to prove BARD that one or more elements of the defence do not apply. (e.g., there was no reasonable possibility that the accused acted on the sudden\u0026hellip;)\nThe Supreme Court in Tran held: \u0026ldquo;For the defence to succeed, the jury must have a reasonable doubt about whether each of the elements of provocation was present.\u0026rdquo; Put otherwise, the jury must conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that each element applies.\nProvocation is not a defence to attempted murder; but evidence of provocation may be invoked here to raise a doubt about whether the accused had the specific intent to kill. (Campbell)\nSpecific points: #  In the first part of the Hill test, the \u0026lsquo;ordinary person\u0026rsquo; is:\n-not exceptionally excitable, pugnacious or drunk;\n -the same age, race, and sex as the accused, if these are relevant to a \u0026lsquo;particular feature of the provocation in question\u0026rsquo;; and\n -subjected to the same circumstances as the accused. (Hill)\nThe ordinary person also shares the background history between the accused and the victim, and this can be considered when assessing whether the act would suffice to cause the ordinary person to lose self-control. (Thibert)\nThe ordinary person does not share characteristics with the accused that conflict with Charter values: e.g., the accused\u0026rsquo;s homophobia or belief in honour killing. (Tran)\nIn the second part of Hill test, when assessing whether the accused lost self-control, the court can consider all aspects particular to the accused, including intoxication, mental state or psychological temperament, and the history of the relationship with the victim. (Hill, Thibert)\nThe provocative act must be sudden; it cannot amount to knowledge one already possessed.

Fitness to stand trial: #  The accused, the Crown, or the court on its own motion may raise the issue of the accused\u0026rsquo;s fitness to stand trial at any time during a prosecution before the verdict is rendered. (By contrast, the Crown is restricted as to when it may raise the defence of mental disorder. See below.)\nThe accused is presumed to be fit to stand trial, unless the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the accused is not fit. The persuasive burden rests on the party raising the issue of fitness. (section 672.22)\nTest for fitness\nSection 2 of the Criminal Code states that a person is \u0026ldquo;unfit to stand trial\u0026rdquo; where, \u0026ldquo;on account of mental disorder, [she is unable] to conduct a defence at any stage of the proceedings before a verdict is rendered or to instruct counsel to do so, and, in particular, unable on account of mental disorder to:\na. understand the nature or object of the proceedings,\nb. understand the possible consequences of the proceedings, or\nc. communicate with counsel\u0026rdquo;.\n To be found fit under section 2, the accused need only possess a \u0026ldquo;limited cognitive capacity to understand the process and to communicate with counsel.\u0026rdquo; He need not be \u0026ldquo;capable of making rational decisions beneficial to him.\u0026rdquo; (Whittle)\nA person found unfit can be tried at a later time, if he is later found to be fit. If the Crown seeks to preserve the status of a prosecution while waiting for the accused to become fit, the Crown must establish a prima facie case for the offence every two years. (section 672.33)\nA person found unfit to stand trial is remanded to the Review Board for a disposition hearing under section 672.54 (the court can also carry out the disposition hearing but usually remits the matter to the Board). In that hearing, an accused who has been found unfit to stand trial may be released on conditions or be ordered to remain in hospital, but may not be discharged absolutely. (s. 672.54)\nIf the court finds that a person is not likely to ever become fit to stand trial and does not pose a significant threat to public safety, the court may grant a stay of prosecution. (Demers; s. 672.851).1\n2. Mental disorder defence: #  The mental disorder defence is set out in section 16 of the Code, and the phrase \u0026ldquo;mental disorder\u0026rdquo; is a defined term in section 2. The defence serves to exempt a person from criminal liability based on an incapacity for criminal intent or excuse what would otherwise be a criminal offence. (Chaulk)\nThe mental disorder defence\nSection 16 states that a person is not to be found criminally responsible for an act or omission committed \u0026ldquo;while suffering from a mental disorder that rendered the person incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong.\u0026rdquo;\n  (A key element of the test is the causal connection: the failure to appreciate the nature or quality of the act, or to know it was wrong, must be an effect of the mental disorder.)\n Section 2 defines \u0026ldquo;mental disorder\u0026rdquo; as a \u0026ldquo;disease of the mind,\u0026rdquo; thus incorporating the common law definitions of this phrase (see below).\nEither the accused or the Crown may invoke the defence of mental disorder. Before it may be put to the jury, the party seeking to rely on it must establish an air of reality for each element of the defence.\nOnce an air of reality has been established, the burden remains with the party seeking to rely on the defence to persuade the trier of fact that each element of the defence applies on a balance of probabilities.\n This violates the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d), because it allows for a conviction where there is a reasonable doubt about mens rea or the voluntariness of the actus reus. The violation has been held to be a reasonable limit on the right, under s. 1, because, among other reasons, the accused is in the best position to present evidence as to their mental state. (Chaulk)\n While the accused may raise the mental disorder defence at any point during the trial, the Crown may raise the defence in only two instances: (a) once it has established a prima facie case for the elements of the offence (mens rea and actus reus); or (b) when, in the course of the trial, the accused has raised the issue of his or her capacity for criminal intent (e.g., voluntariness, automatism, etc.) (Swain).\nIf the court (or jury) finds that the test in section 16 has been met on a balance of probabilities, the accused is found \u0026ldquo;not criminally responsible due to mental disorder\u0026rdquo; (NCRMD) and remanded to the Review Board for a disposition hearing under section 672.54 within 45 days.\nIf the judge or jury finds that the elements of the mental disorder defence have not been established on a balance of probabilities, the facts supporting the defence may still be considered in assessing whether the mens rea of the offence has been established beyond a reasonable doubt.\n For example, facts relating to the accused\u0026rsquo;s mental state at the time of the offence might fall short of the elements in section 16, but still raise a reasonable doubt about whether a murder was \u0026ldquo;planned and deliberate,\u0026rdquo; or whether the accused had the necessary intent for murder (\u0026ldquo;means to cause death\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;means to cause bodily that he knows is likely cause death\u0026rdquo;). (Swain)\n \u0026lsquo;Disease of the mind\u0026rsquo; #  Whether a person suffers from a \u0026ldquo;disease of the mind\u0026rdquo; is a legal and not a medical issue. Medical evidence assists in deciding the issue but is not determinative. (Simpson)\n\u0026ldquo;Disease of the mind\u0026rdquo; includes \u0026ldquo;any illness, disorder or abnormal condition that impairs the human mind and its functioning, [but excludes] self-induced states caused by alcohol or drugs, as well as transitory mental states such as hysteria or concussion.\u0026rdquo; (Where a person suffers an abnormal mental condition or impairment due to the voluntary consumption of intoxicants, the proper defence is intoxication.) (Cooper)\n\u0026lsquo;Appreciating the nature and quality of the act\u0026rsquo; #  This refers specifically to an ability to perceive the physical consequences, impact, or results of the act (e.g., that the act of choking would cause death). (Cooper)\nIt does not require that the act be \u0026ldquo;accompanied by appropriate feeling [such as guilt or remorse] about the effect of the act on other people.\u0026rdquo; (Cooper)\n\u0026lsquo;Knowing that the act was wrong\u0026rsquo; #  Wrong here means morally wrong or \u0026ldquo;contrary to the ordinary moral standards of reasonable men and women.\u0026rdquo; (Chaulk)\nIt does not require that the accused know only that something was \u0026ldquo;legally wrong.\u0026rdquo; (Chaulk)\nTo fail to know that \u0026ldquo;the act was wrong,\u0026rdquo; the accused must lack an awareness that the act was morally wrong by society\u0026rsquo;s standards. (Chaulk)\n3. Review Board: #  Once a person has been found unfit to stand trial or NCRMD, the Review Board must make the disposition that is \u0026ldquo;necessary and appropriate in the circumstances\u0026rdquo;, taking into account public safety and the needs of the accused \u0026ndash; but with \u0026ldquo;the safety of the public\u0026hellip;the paramount consideration\u0026rdquo;. (Section 672.54)\nDispositions\nThe three dispositions under section 672.54 available to an accused person found NCRMD are:\ni. an absolute discharge,\nii. a conditional discharge, or\niii. detention in custody in the hospital.\n The SCC in Winko held that in a hearing under section 672.54, \u0026ldquo;If the court or Review Board concludes that the NCR accused is not a significant threat to the safety of the public, it must order an absolute discharge.\u0026rdquo;\nA person unfit to stand trial may only be conditionally discharged or detained in hospital. (This would continue until a person is found not likely to ever become fit and the charge is stayed [section 672.54] \u0026ndash; or if the Crown decides to stay the charge, or if the Crown fails to present a prima face case at intervals of up to 2 years and the charge is stayed by the court [s. 672.33].)\nThe Review Board scheme allows for indefinite detention in hospital but was held in Winko to be consistent with section 7 and 11(d) of the Charter, given the requirement in section 672.54 for the least onerous disposition and periodic reviews of detentions or conditional discharges at yearly intervals (or sooner). It is unclear whether this is still the case, given that amended section now requires the order \u0026ldquo;necessary and appropriate in the circumstances\u0026rdquo;, with \u0026ldquo;the safety of the public\u0026hellip;the paramount consideration\u0026rdquo;.\n  The court may also grant a stay where a person does pose a significant threat, under a further test in section 672.851(8). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "}),a.add({id:7,href:'/sum/docs/substantive_topics/8.-necessity/',title:"8.

(The belief is to be assessed on an exclusively subjective basis.) (Mena, Ruzik)\nSection 17 also requires that the threat be immediate and that the person making the threat be present at the time of the offence. In Ruzik, the SCC found that these two requirements violate section 7 of the Charter; the violation cannot be justified under section 1; and as a result, these requirements were struck down, but not the rest of the section.\n (The requirements of immediacy and presence violate s 7 because they allow for a conviction in cases involving \u0026ldquo;morally involuntary\u0026rdquo; acts, which the Court in Ruzik held is contrary to \u0026lsquo;fundamental justice\u0026rsquo;. The violation could not be justified under s 1, given the common law defence as a less impairing measure.)\n Section 17 does not require that at the time of the offence, the accused had no safe avenue of escape or that the offence committed be proportionate to the threat at issue.\nThe only remaining restrictions on the defence of duress in section 17 are that the accused may not rely on the defence if:\ni. she is involved in a \u0026ldquo;conspiracy or [criminal] association\u0026rdquo; with the person making threat; and\nii. the offence at issue is any one of several offences listed in the section, including murder, robbery, sexual assault, and aggravated assault.\nGiven the Charter analysis in Ruzik, these remaining limitations on the defence are likely also to be found contrary to s 7 and not a reasonable limitation on that right under s 1 (given the availability of the common law defence).\nIf section 17 were struck down in its entirety, a principal offender could rely on the defence of duress at common law. (Ruzik)\nThe defence of duress at common law: #  An accused may rely on the defence of duress where:\ni. she was compelled to commit the offence by a threat of death or bodily harm to herself or another person;\nii. there was no safe avenue of escape; and\niii. the offence committed was proportionate to the threat faced. (Ruzik)\n Threats need not be immediate or made by a person present. (Ruzik)\nThe accused\u0026rsquo;s belief that he or she faced a threat of death or bodily harm must be reasonable on a modified objective standard (reasonable person, similarly situated but who shares the \u0026lsquo;characteristics and frailties\u0026rsquo; of the accused). (Ruzik)\n\u0026ldquo;The accused should be expected to demonstrate some fortitude and to put up a normal resistance to the threat.\u0026rdquo; (Ruzik)\nWhether the accused had no safe avenue of escape is assessed on the modified objective standard described above. (Hibbert)\nThe proportionality between the threat and the criminal act to be excused is also measured on the modified objective standard noted above. (Ruzik) (By contrast, in relation to the defence of necessity, the Court in Latimer held that proportionality is to be assessed on a strictly objective standard.)\nOther Points from the case law: #  Duress applies only to an offence committed under compulsion of a threat (of death or bodily harm) made for the purpose of compelling the accused to commit the specific offence. If an accused is threatened without compulsion, her only defence is selfâdefence. (Ryan)\nSection 17 applies only to principal offenders, or \u0026ldquo;a person who commits an offence\u0026rdquo; (Paquette)\nWhere it is unclear whether a person acted as principal or as party, both the common law and statutory defence should be put to the jury, so long as there is an air of reality for each aspect of each defence (Mena)\nWhere a person charged as a party to an offence acts under some form of compulsion, this fact alone would not negate or raise a doubt about whether he or she had the mens rea for aiding or abetting, or acting with a \u0026ldquo;common intention,\u0026rdquo; in sections 21(1) or 21(2). (Those provisions require a basic intent to aid the principal, but not a desire that the principal\u0026rsquo;s crime be committed.) A prima facie case may thus be made out for being a party to an offence, but the accused may then rely on the common law defence of duress \u0026ndash; if she can establish an air of reality for each element of the defence. (Hibbert)\nIn the case of some offences (aside from those in which a person is charged as a party under s 21(1) or (2)), the fact that an accused acted under compulsion may negate, or raise a reasonable doubt about, the particular intent required for the offence even if the elements of the defence of duress at common law or s 17 are not made out.

Presumptions and burdens #  Where the Crown proves fact A, a presumption permits the court to presume fact B. In many cases, fact B is an element of an offence that is difficult for the Crown to prove but flows logically from proof of fact A.\nMost presumptions are rebuttable, some are irrebuttable.\nAmong the class of rebuttable presumptions, we distinguish between evidentiary legal presumptions.\nEvidentiary presumptions: #  Evidentiary presumptions apply in provisions that use the phrase \u0026ldquo;in the absence of evidence to the contrary\u0026rdquo; (or something similar).1\nThey require the accused to adduce (or point to) some evidence to the contrary, but not to prove anything.\nAn evidentiary presumption gives rise to an evidentiary burden (\u0026lsquo;some evidence\u0026rsquo;).\nTest for meeting an evidentiary burden\nThe test for what constitutes an \u0026ldquo;air of reality\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;some evidence,\u0026rdquo; is: \u0026ldquo;any or some evidence on which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could convict\u0026rdquo; (Cinous, Fontaine). Whether this test is met is for the judge to decide, not the jury. (i.e., is there a possibility the contrary fact is true? The Crown must prove \u0026ndash; must persuade the trier of fact \u0026ndash; that there is no reasonable possibility that it is true.)\n Legal presumptions #  Legal presumptions apply in provisions that use the phrase âunless he establishesâ¦â (or something similar).2\nIf the Crown proves fact A, a legal presumption permits the court to presume fact B unless the accused proves otherwise.\nLegal presumptions give rise to a persuasive burden on the accused (a \u0026lsquo;reverse onus\u0026rsquo;). In criminal law, where the persuasive burden falls upon the accused, the standard is proof on a balance of probabilities.\nWhenever a provision of law places an accused in a reverse onus (i.e., imposing a persuasive burden) to prove an essential element of an offence, the provision violates section 11(d) of the Charter. (Oakes)\nIn some cases, the violation might be saved under section 1; in some it may not.3\nii. Presumption of Innocence: #  Sources of the presumption of innocence can be found at common law (Woolmington), section 6 of the Criminal Code, and section 11(d) of the Charter, which guarantees the right:\n \u0026ldquo;to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.\u0026rdquo;\n The SCC in Oakes affirmed that the presumption of innocence in 11(d) requires the Crown to prove the elements of an offence beyond a reasonable doubt.\nIn Woolmington, the UK House of Lords held that once the Crown establishes a prima facie case for the elements of an offence, the burden does not shift to the accused to prove a defence. The burden remains on the Crown to prove that a defence does not apply.\nWoolmington and Oakes note an exception to this rule. An accused seeking to rely on the defence of mental disorder bears the onus of proving it (on a balance of probabilities).4\niii. The requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt #  The SCC in Lifchus held that \u0026lsquo;reasonable doubt\u0026rsquo; has a special meaning in law, which should be explained to juries:\n -it is not based on sympathy or prejudice\n-it is logically connected to the evidence or absence of it\n-it is based upon reason and common sense\n-it is not proof to an absolute certainty; it is not proof beyond any doubt, nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt\n-it is not met where accused is \u0026ldquo;probably guilty\u0026rdquo;\n In Starr, the SCC held that the reasonable doubt standard is \u0026ldquo;much closer to absolute certainty than to proof on a balance of probabilities\u0026rdquo;.\n  See Code section 348(2) for an example. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n See Code section 320.35 for an example. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n For example, the one in Chaulk is saved (mental disorder); the one in Oakes is not (intention for trafficking). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The burden also shifts to the accused where they seek to rely on other defences premised on a lack of voluntariness: extreme intoxication and automatism.
