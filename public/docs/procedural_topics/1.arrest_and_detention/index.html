<p>Section 9 of the <em>Charter</em> guarantees everyone a right &ldquo;not to be
arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in <em>R v Le</em> held that in order to be valid under section 9, a detention must be &ldquo;authorized by law; the authorizing law itself must not be arbitrary; and, the manner in which the detention is carried out must be reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A person is detained within the meaning of section 9 where police conduct would cause a reasonable person in the circumstances to conclude that he or she was not free to go and had to comply with a police direction or demand.</p>
<p>If not a person is detained or under arrest, police may question them and the person may
refuse to cooperate. This includes questions pertaining to identity unless, in the context, there is a legal requirement to provide this. (<em>Grant</em>, <em>Le</em>)</p>
<p>Police have the power to carry out an &lsquo;investigative detention&rsquo; where
they have a reasonable <em>suspicion</em> implicating the person in an offence
being investigated and where it is reasonably necessary on an objective
view of the totality of the circumstances (<em>Mann</em>). An investigative
detention triggers 10(a) and (b) of the <em>Charter</em> [more detail below].</p>
<p>Police also have the power to carry out a limited frisk <strong>search</strong>
incident to investigative detention where they have a reasonable
<em>suspicion</em> that safety is at risk [for more on this, see the &ldquo;Search and Seizure&rdquo; summary].</p>
<p>Police may arrest on grounds set out in section 495(1) and in certain
other situations (under statute and common law: <em>e.g.</em>, breach of the
peace under s. 31 of the <em>Code</em> and at CL: <em>Hayes v Thompson</em>).</p>
<p>Police may carry out a limited search incident to arrest without
requiring further grounds. A strip search upon arrest requires
additional grounds, and a strip search at the scene of arrest requires
grounds in addition to those [for more on this, see the &ldquo;Search and Seizure&rdquo; summary].</p>

  <a class="anchor" href="#a-powers-of-police-under-s-495">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Pursuant to section 495(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, a PO may arrest a
person where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that an
individual is subject to an arrest warrant, or has committed or is about
to commit an indictable offence [which includes a hybrid offence], or
if she finds a person committing <strong>any</strong> offence.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Meaning of reasonable grounds</em></p>
<p>As explained in the &lsquo;Note on Standards&rsquo; below, the phrase &lsquo;reasonable grounds to believe&rsquo; in s 495(1) is read synonymously in the case law with &lsquo;reasonable and probable grounds to believe.&rsquo; Under s 495(1), an officer must believe that a suspect has <em>probably</em> committed or is probably about to commit an indictable offence. Probable grounds requires &ldquo;a reasonable belief that an individual is connected to the offence&rdquo;; it exist when there is &ldquo;an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information&rdquo; (<em>Beaver</em>).</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in <em>Storrey</em> held that an officer must hold the &lsquo;reasonable belief&rsquo; in (what is now) section 495(1) <em>subjectively</em> and the belief must also be <em>objectively</em> reasonable.</p>
<p>The officer must &ldquo;honestly believe that the suspect committed the offence&rdquo; (<em>Shepard</em>), and the belief will be objectively reasonable where &ldquo;[a] reasonable person, standing in the shoes of the police officer, would have believed that reasonable and probable grounds existed to make the arrest.&rdquo; (<em>Storrey</em>)</p>
<p>The reasonable person here would share &ldquo;the officer’s knowledge, experience and training&rdquo; when assessing whether, in &ldquo;the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the arrest,&rdquo; there were reasonable grounds to arrest. (<em>St Clair</em>, ONCA)</p>
<p>When one officer directs another officer to make an arrest, only the directing officer need have reasonable and probable grounds. (<em>Beaver</em>, <em>Debot</em>)</p>
<p>Where an officer&rsquo;s grounds for arrest are based on a mistake of law (<em>i.e.</em>, assuming facts before her amount to something that is not an offence), the arrest is invalid however reasonable the mistake may have been. (<em>Tim</em>)</p>
<p>Whether an officer had reasonable grounds (or not) is a question of law, subject on appeal to the standard of correctness.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (<em>Shepherd</em>)</p>

  b) Powers of citizens and property owners under s 494
  <a class="anchor" href="#b-powers-of-citizens-and-property-owners-under-s-494">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Persons other than peace officers may arrest without a warrant anyone
they find committing an indictable office, <strong>or</strong> anyone they have
reasonable grounds to believe has committed a &lsquo;criminal offence&rsquo;
(summary or indictable) <strong>and</strong> is being freshly pursued by someone with
lawful authority to arrest: s. 494. By contrast (to other civilians), property owners may arrest a person they find committing a &lsquo;criminal offence&rsquo; (see s.
494(2) for further qualifications).</p>
<h3 id="c-other-code-powers">
  c) Other <em>Code</em> powers
  <a class="anchor" href="#c-other-code-powers">#</a>
</h3>
<p><em>Breach of undertaking</em></p>
<p>The Code contains a host of other arrest powers relied upon less often than those in 495(1), including the power in s 495.1 to carry out an arrest without warrant on reasonable grounds to believe an accused has breached (or will) terms of a summons, appearance notice, undertaking or release order; and powers to arrest for &lsquo;breach of the peace&rsquo; (ss 30 and 31).</p>
<p><em>Breach of the peace</em></p>
<p>Breach of the peace involves actions that cause or are likely to cause harm to persons or property. The Code authorizes detention or arrest for this, but does not make it an offence. Civilians may detain for breaches of peace they witness (s. 30); police for this but also at common law for those immediately imminent (s. 31 and <em>Thompson v Hayes</em>, BCCA 1985; <em>Brown v Durham</em>, OCA 1998).</p>
<p><em>Warrantless entry to effect arrest</em></p>
<p>Under section 529.3(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, police may enter a
dwelling house <strong>without a warrant</strong> in order to carry out an arrest
where they have reasonable grounds to believe the person is present and
the conditions are present to obtain a warrant under 529.1 (RPG) but due
to exigent circumstances this is not practicable.</p>
<p>For the purposes of
this section, exigent circs are defined 529.3(2) to require (a)
reasonable grounds to <em>suspect</em> that it is necessary to prevent imminent
danger of bodily harm or death, <strong>or</strong> (b) reasonable grounds to
<em>believe</em> that entry is necessary to prevent against the <strong>imminent</strong>
loss or destruction of evidence of an <strong>indictable</strong> offence.</p>
<p><em>Use of force</em></p>
<p>A PO or civilian may use as much force as is reasonably necessary to
effect a lawful arrest, s 25(1).</p>
<h3 id="d-general-principle-supporting-release">
  d) General principle supporting release
  <a class="anchor" href="#d-general-principle-supporting-release">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Section 493.1 compels police officers and judges to &ldquo;give primary consideration to the release of the accused at the earliest reasonable opportunity and on the least onerous conditions that are appropriate in the circumstances&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Police must also &ldquo;give particular attention to the circumstances of (a) aboriginal accused; and (b) accused who belong to a vulnerable population that is overrepresented in the criminal justice system and that is disadvantaged in obtaining release under this Part&rdquo; (493.2).</p>
<p><em>Public interest grounds</em></p>
<p>For a range of offences set out in section 495(2) [summary, hybrid, and
indictable offences under s. 553], police must release a person immediately after &ldquo;arrest&rdquo; (or in lieu of carrying out a full arrest) unless detaining
them further is necessary for any of the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; reasons set
out in s. 495(2) (ID, evidence, avoiding continuation/repetition of
offence, or to ensure court attendance).</p>
<h2 id="2-investigative-detention">
  2. Investigative detention
  <a class="anchor" href="#2-investigative-detention">#</a>
</h2>
<p>At common law, police have a power to detain a person briefly for
investigative purposes.</p>
<p>Where a person is subject to an &lsquo;investigative detention&rsquo;, their rights under
under sections 9 and 10(a) and (b) of the <em>Charter</em> right are engaged. (<em>Mann</em>, <em>Grant</em>)</p>
<p>Police are authorized to conduct an &lsquo;investigative detention&rsquo; when they have</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>(a) a reasonable <em>suspicion</em> that the individual is implicated in the offence
being investigated and</p>
<p>(b) where the detention is reasonably necessary
on an objective view of the totality of the circumstances.  (<em>Mann</em>)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>On the first point: there must be a clear nexus, based in evidence, tying the <em>particular</em>
person detained to the offence being investigated (&ldquo;individualized
suspicion&rdquo;). Courts will assess whether an officer had a &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo;
suspicion by considering the reasonable person in the officer&rsquo;s
position. (<em>Mann</em>)</p>
<p>On the second point: factors to consider here include &ldquo;the extent to which the interference with individual liberty is necessary to perform the officer&rsquo;s duty [to
investigate crime], the liberty interfered with, and the nature and
extent of the interference.&rdquo; (<em>Mann</em>)</p>
<p>As noted, an investigative detention triggers both 10(a) and 10(b). Police must
inform the detainee, without delay, of the reason for the detention and
their right to retain counsel. But police may briefly delay discharging
their duties under 10(b) to carry out a safety search. (<em>Grant</em>,
<em>Suberu</em>)</p>
<p>Investigative detention is distinct from what the Supreme Court has
called &ldquo;preliminary investigative questioning.&rdquo; A person here is not
detained and police are not obliged to advise them that they do not have
to answer questions. (<em>Suberu</em>)</p>
<p><em>Blockades</em></p>
<p>The Court in <em>Clayton</em> held that police may set up a blockade and detain for investigative purposes persons if (a) doing so still involves individualized suspicion (or a nexus tying detainees to the offence being investigated) and (b) where it is reasonably necessary to do so based on the totality of the
circumstances, including:</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>i.  the nature of the situation (including the seriousness of the
offence);</p>
<p>ii. the information known to the police about the crime and/or the
suspects; and</p>
<p>iii. whether the stop/detention (<em>i.e.</em> geographic and temporal scope)
is reasonably tailored to the offence, and in balancing the risk to
the public versus the liberty of citizens, the stop is no more
intrusive than is &ldquo;reasonably necessary.&rdquo; (<em>Clayton</em>)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An investigative detention should be brief, but may be as broad (in time
or space) as is &ldquo;reasonably necessary in the totality of the
circumstances,&rdquo; so long as its purpose is restricted to investigating
the involvement in crime of particular suspects. (<em>Clayton)</em></p>
<h2 id="3-test-for-whether-and-when-a-detention-has-occurred">
  3. Test for whether and when a &lsquo;detention&rsquo; has occurred
  <a class="anchor" href="#3-test-for-whether-and-when-a-detention-has-occurred">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In <em>Grant</em>, the Supreme Court set out a test for deciding whether a
&ldquo;detention&rdquo; for the purpose of sections 9 and 10 of the <em>Charter</em> has occurred. A person is &ldquo;detained&rdquo; where there is <strong>significant</strong>:</p>
<p>a. physical restraint, or</p>
<p>b. psychological compulsion.</p>
<p>-psychological compulsion is established where there is:</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>i. legal compulsion: where an officer makes a demand to comply pursuant to statute: <em>eg</em>, a roadside breath demand; <strong>or</strong></p>
<p>ii. non-legal compulsion, which arises in circumstances where &ldquo;police
conduct would cause a <strong>reasonable</strong> person conclude that he or she
was not free to go and had to comply with the police direction or
demand.&rdquo; [The test is purely <strong>objective</strong>.]</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Court in <em>Grant</em> held that whether the reasonable person subject
to non-legal compulsion would conclude they were detained depends on
the following criteria considered in their totality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i.  circumstances giving rise to the encounter as reasonably perceived
by the individual [were they subject to general inquiries or
singled out?];</p>
<p>ii. nature of the police conduct [language, duration, place, physical
contact, presence of others, etc.];</p>
<p>iii. particular characteristics/circumstances of the individual [age,
physical stature, sophistication, being a member of a racial
minority].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court in <em>Le</em> held that under the 3rd part of this test,
the reasonable person in the position of a racialized person is presumed
to be aware of the &ldquo;broader historical and social context of race
relations between the police and various racial groups and individuals
in society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the broader &lsquo;racialized context&rsquo; of a police encounter with a visible
minority, it is irrelevant whether the police involved engaged in racial
profiling when assessing whether the reasonable person would have
experienced significant compulsion. (<em>Le</em>)</p>
<p>In a given set of circumstances, a racialized accused might be more
likely than a white person to infer that they have no choice but to
comply with a police direction or demand &ndash; and this inference may be
reasonable in the circumstances, based on the weight of recent social
science evidence. (<em>Le</em>)</p>
<p>The detention analysis in <em>Grant</em> and <em>Le</em> is principally objective in
nature. (Evidence of what the police or the accused personally perceived
is important, but not determinative of whether the factors pointing to
psychological detention were, in their totality, <em>significant</em>.)</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in <em>Lafrance</em> (2022) held that &ldquo;no single consideration, including a police statement to an individual that he or she is &lsquo;not detained&rsquo; or otherwise under any obligation to cooperate or may leave, is determinative of whether a detention has occurred.&rdquo; This is only one consideration among others &ldquo;for which a court should account in deciding whether a reasonable person in the shoes of the accused would feel obliged to cooperate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The common law makes the following distinctions on standards in criminal law:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;<strong>suspicion</strong>&rsquo; would be something merely <em>possible</em>, even if its
probability is low;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a &lsquo;<strong>reasonable suspicion</strong>&rsquo; would be a <em>reasonable possibility</em>, or
something not quite probable but more than hypothetical (SCC:
<em>Kang-Brown</em>, <em>Chehil</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;<strong>reasonable grounds to believe</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>reasonable belief</strong>&rsquo; have been
held by the SCC in <em>Debot</em> and <em>Baron</em> to be synonymous with
&lsquo;<strong>reasonable and probable grounds</strong>,&rsquo; and each is a way of saying there is a <em>reasonable probability</em> of something<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;<strong>balance of probability</strong>&rsquo; means <em>greater likelihood</em> or &lsquo;more likely
than not&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Justice Jamal, for majority of the SCC in <em>Beaver</em> (2022), held that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reasonable suspicion requires a <em>reasonable possibility</em> of crime, while reasonable and probable grounds requires a <em>reasonable probability</em> of crime [&hellip;] At the same time, police do not require a prima facie case for conviction before making an arrest [&hellip;] Nor do the police need to establish that the offence was committed on a balance of probabilities. Instead, the reasonable and probable grounds standard requires “a reasonable belief that an individual is connected to the offence” [&hellip;]. A reasonable belief exists when “there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information” [&hellip;]. The police are also not required to undertake further investigation to seek exculpatory facts or to rule out possible innocent explanations for the events before making an arrest.

<p>Section 34(1)(a) of the <em>Interpretation Act</em> defines an
&lsquo;indictable offence&rsquo; to include hybrid offences; see also <em>R v
Dudley</em>, SCC 2009, applying this provision to the meaning of
&lsquo;indictable offence&rsquo; in the <em>Criminal Code</em>. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>By contrast, a trial judge’s findings of fact with respect to the “existence of reasonable and probable grounds” are reviewable “only for palpable and overriding error”: <em>Beaver</em> (SCC 2022). <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Some authorities had suggested the SCC decisions in <em>Debot</em>, <em>Baron</em>,
and <em>Storrey</em> support the proposition that &lsquo;reasonable and probable grounds&rsquo; means balance of probabilities or &lsquo;more likely than not&rsquo;, despite the Court not having stated this explicitly in those cases. The majority in <em>R v Beaver</em>, 2022 SCC 54 has now settled this by holding that RPG does <em>not</em> mean &lsquo;more likely than not,&rsquo; which suggests that it may involve a probability less than that (but still a reasonable probability). The precise level of
probability for RPG remains unclear. For an example of a recent court
decision outlining the state of this uncertainty, see paras 145-157
in <em>Can v Calgary (Police Service),</em> 2014 ABCA 322, which should now be read in light of <em>R v Beaver</em>. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
