      <description>Overview of Wiretap and Electronic Surveillance #  Preliminary points #  The Supreme Court held in Duarte and Wong that where police record a private conversation, they carry out a search.

Part VI of the Code has three features.</description>

      <description>Confessions Summary #  Preliminary Considerations: #  Was the accused&amp;rsquo;s statement a confession or &amp;lsquo;res gestae&amp;rsquo;?
Res gestae statements are those made spontaneously, during or soon after an offence takes place.
At common law, they are admissible and an exception to the voluntariness rule.
Where police obtain a statement from the accused that is not res gestae, the accused may challenge its admissibility on the basis that it was obtained contrary to (a) the common law Confessions Rule,</description>

      <description>Summary of Exclusion Under 24(2) #  Where an accused establishes that a Charter right has been breached in the course of an investigation or prosecution, section 24(2) of the Charter allows for the exclusion of the evidence obtained as a consequence of the breach.
Section 24(2) states: &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;hellip;a court concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</description>

      <description>Summary of law on Actus Reus #  General points on actus reus: #  The actus reus can be defined as &amp;ldquo;a physically voluntary act or omission.&amp;rdquo;
For an offence to be committed, the actus reus and mens rea must be concurrent&amp;mdash;on the principle that if not, courts would punish either conduct without fault or guilty intent not expressed in guilty action.
The actus reus of an offence must be carried out voluntarily and can include the failure to act.</description>

      <description>Summary of law on Mens Rea #  General points on mens rea: #  There is no single kind or level of fault that applies to all criminal or regulatory offences.
The Supreme Court has held that it is a principle of fundamental justice under section 7 of the Charter that a person should not be convicted of a criminal offence without the Crown having to prove a fault element, and one that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence.</description>

      <guid>https://robertdiab.ca/sum/docs/substantive_topics/3.-homicide/</guid>
      <description>Summary of Homicide #  General points: #  Section 222 of the Criminal Code defines homicide as directly or indirectly causing the death of a human being. The Code sets out four forms of homicide: non-culpable, murder, manslaughter or infanticide.
Section 234 states &amp;ldquo;culpable homicide that is not murder or infanticide is manslaughter.&amp;rdquo;
Infanticide functions as both an offence (mother killing baby when still suffering post-partum effects) and a partial defence to murder (lowering murder to manslaughter).</description>

      <description>Summary of Provocation #  General points: #  Section 232(1) states: &amp;ldquo;Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.&amp;rdquo;
Section 232(2) defines provocation as follows: &amp;ldquo;Conduct of the victim that would constitute an indictable offence under this Act that is punishable by five or more years of imprisonment and that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section, if the accused acted on it on the sudden and before there was time for their passion to cool.</description>

      <description>Summary of Self-Defence #  General points: #  The self-defence provisions in section 34 of the Code function as a full defence (resulting in acquittal) to any offence committed with the purpose of defending or protecting oneself or another from the use or threat of force, if the act committed in defence is reasonable in the circumstances.
Elements of the defence in s 34(1)
-the accused reasonably believes that force, or a threat of force, is being used/made against her or another;</description>

      <guid>https://robertdiab.ca/sum/docs/substantive_topics/7.-necessity/</guid>
      <description>Summary of Necessity #  General Points #  The defence of necessity excuses criminal conduct (resulting in an acquittal) where an accused facing &amp;ldquo;clear and imminent peril&amp;rdquo; acts to avoid a greater harm &amp;ndash; rendering their conduct &amp;ldquo;morally involuntary.&amp;rdquo; The Court in Perka recognized the defence at common law; it applies to all criminal offences, possibly including murder. (Latimer)
Before the defence may be put to a jury, the accused must raise an air of reality with respect to each element of the defence; the burden then shifts to the Crown to prove BARD that one or more elements do not apply.</description>

      <description>Summary of Duress #  General Points #  The defence of duress excuses a person (resulting in an acquittal) for a criminal act they commit when threatened or compelled by another person.
Duress may apply:
i. as a defence available under s 17 of the Code to a principal offender who commits the offence;

      <description>Summary of Intoxication #  General Points #  The courts have distinguished three distinct defences involving intoxication:
a. self-induced intoxication;
b. extreme intoxication; and
c. involuntary intoxication
 Crimes of Specific and General Intent: #  The application of the first two defences involves a distinction between crimes of &amp;lsquo;specific intent,&amp;rsquo; which require &amp;ldquo;an ulterior object beyond the immediate act,&amp;rdquo; and crimes of &amp;lsquo;general intent,&amp;rsquo; which require &amp;ldquo;proof only of an intent to perform the immediate act.</description>

      <description>Summary of Presumptions, Burdens, and Reasonable Doubt #  i. Presumptions and burdens #  Where the Crown proves fact A, a presumption permits the court to presume fact B. In many cases, fact B is an element of an offence that is difficult for the Crown to prove but flows logically from proof of fact A.
Most presumptions are rebuttable, some are irrebuttable.
Among the class of rebuttable presumptions, we distinguish between evidentiary legal presumptions.</description>

      <description>Sentencing #  General Points #  Before sentencing, counsel will:
  Ascertain the range of sentence by looking at the penalty provisions in the Code or statute;
  Decide on a sentence to recommend (kind and quantum of time, money)
  Seek to support the recommendation by citing purposes and principles in Code or statute.
   1. Kind and range of sentence #  Code provisions will indicate whether an offence is strictly summary or indictable, or hybrid.</description>
